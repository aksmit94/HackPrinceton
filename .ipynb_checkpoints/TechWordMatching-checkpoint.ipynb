Here we present GMRT 21-cm HI line mapping of CIG 340\\nwhich was selected because its integrated HI spectrum has a very symmetric\\nprofile, Aflux = 1.03. Optical images of the galaxy hinted at a warped disk in\\ncontrast to the symmetric integrated HI spectrum profile. Our aim is to\\ndetermine the extent to which the optical asymmetry is reflected in the\\nresolved HI morphology and kinematics. GMRT observations reveal significant HI\\nmorphological asymmetries in CIG 340 despite it\\'s overall symmetric optical\\nform and highly symmetric HI spectrum. The most notable HI features are: 1) a\\nwarp in the HI disk (with an optical counterpart), 2) the HI north/south flux\\nratio = 1.32 is much larger than expected from the integrated HI spectrum\\nprofile and 3) a ~ 45\" (12 kpc) HI extension, containing ~ 6% of the detected\\nHI mass on the northern side of the disk. We conclude that in isolated galaxies\\na highly symmetric HI spectrum can mask significant HI morphological\\nasymmetries. The northern HI extension appears to be the result of a recent\\nperturbation (10^8 yr), possibly by a satellite which is now disrupted or\\nprojected within the disk. This study provides an important step in our ongoing\\nprogram to determine the predominant source of HI asymmetries in isolated\\ngalaxies. For CIG 340 the isolation from major companions, symmetric HI\\nspectrum, optical morphology and interaction timescales have allowed us to\\nnarrow the possible causes the HI asymmetries and identify tests to further\\nconstrain the source of the asymmetries.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>T.

We develop a novel\\nstatistical method for predicting the HI-to-stellar mass ratio\\n$f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}}$ of galaxies from their stellar mass and optical colour, and\\napply it to a volume-limited galaxy sample jointly observed by the Sloan\\nDigital Sky Survey and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We eliminate the\\nimpact of the Malmquist bias against HI-deficient systems on the\\n$f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}}$ predictor by properly accounting for the HI detection\\nprobability of each galaxy in the analysis. The best-fitting $f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}}$\\npredictor, with an estimated scatter of $0.272$ dex, provides excellent\\ndescription to the observed HI mass function. After defining an HI excess\\nparameter as the deviation of the observed $f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}}$ from the expected\\nvalue, we confirm that there exists a strong secondary dependence of the\\nmass-metallicity relation on HI excess. By further examining the 2D metallicity\\ndistribution on the specific star formation rate vs. HI excess plane, we\\ndemonstrate that the metallicity dependence on HI is more fundamental than that\\non specific star formation rate. In addition, we show that the environmental\\ndependence of HI in the local Universe can be effectively described by the\\ncross-correlation coefficient between HI excess and the red galaxy overdensity\\n$\\\\rho_{cc}{=}-0.18$. This weak anti-correlation also successfully explains the\\nobserved dependence of HI clustering on $f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}}$.

The pitch angles of the\\nSagittarius-Carina, Perseus, and Outer arms were estimated to be about\\n$11\\\\arcdeg$, $18\\\\arcdeg$, and $7\\\\arcdeg$, respectively.

The inner HI disk is also found to be tilting. The radius of the HI\\ndisk is about 17 kpc and the HI mass within this radius is estimated to be $2.5\\n\\\\times 10^9$ M$_\\\\odot$, which corresponds to 1.5 % of the dynamical mass\\npredicted from the rotation curve.

It is not known which effect prevails. We study\\nthe relation between HI shells and CO in the outer parts of the Milky Way,\\nusing HI and CO surveys and a catalogue of previously identified HI shells. For\\neach individual location, the distance to the nearest HI shell is calculated\\nand it is specified whether it lies in the interior of an HI shell, in its\\nwalls, or outside an HI shell. The method takes into account irregular shapes\\nof HI shells. We find a lack of CO clouds in the interiors of HI shells and\\ntheir increased occurrence in walls. Properties of clouds differ for different\\nenvironments: interiors of HI shells, their walls, and unperturbed medium. CO\\nclouds found in the interiors of HI shells are those that survived and were\\nrobbed of their more diffuse gas. Walls of HI shells have a high molecular\\ncontent, indicative of an increased rate of CO formation. Comparing the CO\\nfractions within HI shells and outside in the unperturbed medium, we conclude\\nthat HI shells are responsible for approx. 20 % increase in the total amount of\\nCO in the outer Milky Way.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Sona Ehlerova</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jan Palous</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1051/0004-6361/201526870</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526870\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">accepted by A&amp;A, 10 pages</arxiv:comment>\\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">A&amp;A 587, A5 (2016)</arxiv:journal_ref>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07047v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07047v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6622v1</id>\\n    <updated>2013-02-26T22:58:10Z</updated>\\n    <published>2013-02-26T22:58:10Z</published>\\n    <title>The evolution of HI and CIV quasar absorption line systems at 1.9 &lt; z &lt;\\n  3.2</title>\\n    <summary>  We have investigated the distribution and evolution of ~3100 intergalactic HI\\nabsorbers with HI column densities log N(HI) = [12.75, 17.0] at 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.2,\\nusing 18 high resolution, high S/N quasar spectra obtained from the ESO\\nVLT/UVES archive. We used two sets of Voigt profile fitting analysis, one\\nincluding all the available high-order Lyman lines to obtain reliable HI column\\ndensities of saturated lines, and another using only the Ly-alpha lines. There\\nis no significant difference between the results from the two fits. Combining\\nour results with literature data, the mean number density at 0 &lt; z &lt; 4 is not\\nwell described by a single power law and strongly suggests that its evolution\\nslows down at z &lt; 1.5 at the high and low column density ranges. We also\\ndivided our entire HI absorbers at 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 into two samples, the\\nunenriched forest and the CIV-enriched forest, depending on whether HI lines\\nare associated with CIV at log N(CIV) &gt; 12.2 within a given velocity range. The\\nentire HI column density distribution function (CDDF) can be described as the\\ncombination of these two well-characterised populations which overlap at log\\nN(HI) ~ 15. At log N(HI) &lt; 15, the unenriched forest dominates, showing a\\nsimilar power-law distribution to the entire forest. The CIV-enriched forest\\ndominates at log N(HI) &gt; 15, with its distribution function proportional to\\nN(HI)^(-1.45). However, it starts to flatten out at lower N(HI), since the\\nenriched forest fraction decreases with decreasing N(HI). The deviation from\\nthe power law at log N(HI) = [14, 17] shown in the CDDF for the entire HI\\nsample is a result of combining two different HI populations with a different\\nCDDF shape. The total HI mass density relative to the critical density is\\nOmega(HI) ~ 1.6 x 10^(-6) h^(-1), where the enriched forest accounts for ~40%\\nof Omega(HI).\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Tae-Sun Kim</name>\\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Leibniz-Institut f\\xc3\\xbcr Astrophysik Potsdam, Germany</arxiv:affiliation>\\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI</arxiv:affiliation>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Adrian M.

HI\\n  Sizes and Morphology</title>\\n    <summary>  We introduce the \"Bluedisk\" project, a large program at the Westerbork\\nSynthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) that has mapped the HI in a sample of 23\\nnearby galaxies with unusually high HI mass fractions, along with a\\nsimilar-sized sample of control galaxies matched in stellar mass, size,\\ninclination and redshift. This paper presents the sample selection,\\nobservational set-up, data reduction strategy, and a first analysis of the\\nsizes and structural properties of the HI disks. We find that the HI-rich\\ngalaxies lie on the same HI mass versus HI size relation as normal spiral\\ngalaxies, extending it to total HI masses of $2 \\\\times 10^{10} M_{\\\\odot}$ and\\nradii R1 of $\\\\sim 100$ kpc (where R1 is defined as the radius where the HI\\ncolumn density reaches 1 $M_{\\\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). HI-rich galaxies have\\nsignificantly larger values of HI-to-optical size ratio at fixed stellar mass,\\nconcentration index, stellar and star formation rate surface density compared\\nto the control sample. The disks of HI-rich galaxies are also significantly\\nmore clumpy (i.e. have higher HI Gini and $\\\\Delta$Area coefficient) than those\\nof normal spirals. There is no evidence that the disks of HI-rich galaxies are\\nmore disturbed: HI-rich galaxies exhibit no difference with respect to control\\nsamples in their distributions of HI asymmetry indices or optical/HI disk\\nposition angle differences. In fact, the center of the HI distribution\\ncorresponds more closely with the center of the optical light in the HI-rich\\ngalaxies than in the controls. All these results argue against a scenario in\\nwhich new gas has been brought in by mergers. It is possible that they may be\\nmore consistent with cooling from a surrounding quasi-static halo of warm/hot\\ngas.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jing Wang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Guinevere Kauffmann</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Gyula I.

We propose that this HI bridge\\ncan be formed as a result of the past interaction between M31 and M33 based on\\ntest particle simulations with different orbits of M31 and M33 for the last ~ 9\\nGyr. We show that strong tidal interaction between M31 and M33 about 4-8 Gyr\\nago can strip HI gas from M33 to form HI streams around M31 which can be\\nobserved as a HI bridge if they are projected onto the sky. We show that the\\nnumber fraction of models reproducing well the observed HI distribution of the\\nbridge is only ~0.01% (i.e., ~10 among ~10^5 models) and thus suggest that the\\nobserved structure and kinematics of the HI bridge can give some constraints on\\nthe past orbits of M31 and M33. We suggest that the observed outer HI warp in\\nM33 could be fossil evidence for the past M31-M33 interaction. We also suggest\\nthat some of high velocity clouds (HVCs) recently found in M31 could be HI gas\\noriginating from M33.

Assuming a distance of\\n2.2 Mpc, we find a total HI mass of 1.3 * 10^8 M_sun to be distributed in the\\nform of a dense, clumpy ridge surrounded by more extended diffuse HI containing\\na few additional discrete features, such as a Western HI Arm and an HI bridge\\nreaching out to a small counterrotating companion cloud. About 10% by mass of\\nall HI in NGC 1569 is at unusually high velocities. Some of this HI may be\\nassociated with the mass outflow evident from H-alpha measurements, but some\\nmay also be associated with NGC 1569\\'s HI companion and intervening HI bridge,\\nin which case, infall rather than outflow might be the cause of the discrepant\\nvelocities. No indication of a large bubble structure was found in\\nposition-velocity maps of the high-velocity HI. The galaxy as a whole is in\\nmodest overall rotation, but the HI gas lacks any sign of rotation within 60\\'\\'\\n(0.6 kpc) from the center, i.e. over most of the optical galaxy. Here,\\nturbulent motions resulting from the starburst appear to dominate over\\nrotation. In the outer disk, the rotational velocities reach a maximum of 35\\n\\\\pm 6 km/s, but turbulent motion remains significant. Thus, starburst effects\\nare still noticeable in the outer HI disk, although they are no longer dominant\\nbeyond 0.6 kpc. Even excluding the most extreme high-velocity HI clouds, NGC\\n1569 still has an unusually high mean HI velocity dispersion of sigma_v=21.3\\nkm/s, more than double that of other dwarf galaxies.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>J.

Clearly\\nevident in the HI data cube is the presence of an anomalous HI component that\\nis both diffuse and slow-rotating. The data cube is dynamically decomposed into\\nregular and anomalous HI components. A mass of M_HI=1.5 x 10^9 Msun is\\nestimated for the anomalous HI - 20 per cent of the total HI mass. Standard HI\\ndata products and rotation curves are produced for each dynamical component. In\\nterms of circular rotation speed, the anomalous HI is found to lag the regular\\nHI by ~25 - 125 km/s. Three-dimensional models are generated and used to\\ndetermine the possible location of the anomalous HI. The results strongly\\nsuggest it to be distributed in a thick disc with a scale-height of a few kpc\\n(~3.5 kpc). It is concluded that the anomalous HI in NGC 3521 constitutes a\\nslow-rotating halo gas component, consistent with similar findings for other\\nnearby galaxies. A study of the radial distribution of the anomalous HI shows\\nit to be spatially coincident with the inner regions of the stellar disc where\\nthe star formation rate is highest.

This filament is made up of several HI clouds and\\nthe diffuse HI gas between them, with no optical counterparts. We compare its\\nHI distribution with other one-sided HI distributions in the literature, and\\nfind that the overall HI distribution is very different from the typical tidal\\nand ram-pressure stripped HI shape, and its morphology is inconsistent with\\nbeing a pure accretion event. Only about 30% of the total HI gas is anchored on\\nthe stellar disk, while most of HI gas forms the filament in the west. At a\\nprojected distance of 122 kpc, we find a massive elliptical companion (NGC\\n6146) with extended radio emission, whose axis points to an HI gap in NGC 6145.\\nThe velocity of the HI filament shows an overall light-of- sight motion of 80\\nto 180 km/s with respect to NGC 6145. Using the long-slit spectra of NGC 6145\\nalong its major stellar axis, we find that some outer regions show enhanced\\nstar formation, while in contrast, almost no star formation activities are\\nfound in its center (less than 2 kpc). Pure accretion, tidal or ram-pressure\\nstripping is not likely to produce the observed HI filament. An alternative\\nexplanation is the jet-stripping from NGC 6146, although direct evidence for a\\njet-cold gas interaction has not been found.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Enci Wang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jing Wang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Xu Kong</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Fulai Guo</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lin Lin</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Guobin Mou</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Cheng Li</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Ting Xiao</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.3847/1538-3881/aa7dde</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aa7dde\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">12 pages, 6 figures; Accepted for publication in AJ</arxiv:comment>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00543v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00543v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.HE\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3223v1</id>\\n    <updated>2010-03-16T19:20:08Z</updated>\\n    <published>2010-03-16T19:20:08Z</published>\\n    <title>Wolfgang Pauli 1900 to 1930: His Early Physics in Jungian Perspective</title>\\n    <summary>  Wolfgang Pauli\\'s philosophy and physics were intertwined. His philosophy was\\na variety of Platonism, in which Pauli\\'s affiliation with Carl Jung formed an\\nintegral part, but Pauli\\'s philosophical explorations in physics appeared\\nbefore he met Jung. Jung validated Pauli\\'s psycho-philosophical perspective.\\nThus, the roots of Pauli\\'s physics and philosophy are important in the history\\nof modern physics. In his early physics, Pauli attempted to ground his\\ntheoretical physics in positivism. He then began instead to trust his intuitive\\nvisualizations of entities that formed an underlying reality to the sensible\\nphysical world. These visualizations included holistic kernels of\\nmathematical-physical entities that later became for him synonymous with Jung\\'s\\nmandalas. I have connected Pauli\\'s visualization patterns in physics during the\\nperiod 1900 to 1930 to the psychological philosophy of Jung and displayed some\\nexamples of Pauli\\'s creativity in the development of quantum mechanics. By\\nlooking at Pauli\\'s early physics and philosophy, we gain insight into Pauli\\'s\\ncontributions to quantum mechanics. His exclusion principle, his influence on\\nWerner Heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm\\nlogical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron\\nspinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum\\nphysicists, all point to Pauli being the dominant genius in the development of\\nquantum theory. Because Pauli was in a difficult individuation process during\\nhis early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often\\ncontradictory. My analysis of Pauli\\'s physics and philosophy is based upon\\npublished and unpublished sources, and Pauli\\'s later reflections. A pattern has\\nemerged. Pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and\\nempiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. This coupled with\\ndisturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led Pauli to seek\\ntreatment at the Jung Clinic. Pauli\\'s psychological tension diminished after\\n1932. His physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. His philosophy\\nallied with Jung\\'s resembled a Platonism of combined psyche and physics. Pauli\\nsought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal\\nwas cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>John R.

In a few luminous early-type galaxies the\\nHI is also in a disk or in a ring-like structure, but in most luminous\\nearly-type galaxies the HI has a relatively irregular morphology. The surface\\ndensities in the HI disks in luminous early-type galaxies are lower than in the\\nHI disks in low-luminosity early-type galaxies and no large-scale star\\nformation should occur in these disks.

We find that the\\nstarless HI clump masses, velocity dispersions and positions allow these clumps\\nto be in pressure equilibrium with the X-ray gas near the virial radius of the\\nVirgo cluster. We predict the sizes of these clumps to range from 1-10 kpc, in\\nagreement with the range of sizes found for spatially resolved HI starless\\nclumps outside of Virgo. Based on the predicted HI surface density of the Virgo\\nsources, as well as a sample of other similar resolved ALFALFA HI dark clumps\\nwith follow up optical/radio observations, we predict that most of the HI dark\\nclumps are on the cusp of forming stars.

Because of a tight correlation between the HI\\nmass and HI cross-section, which we demonstrate spans all galaxy types, we can\\nuse our HI-selected sample to predict the properties of the absorption line\\nsystems. We use measurements of the number density and HI cross-section of\\ngalaxies to show that the total HI cross-section at column densities sufficient\\nto produce damped Lyman-alpha absorption is consistent with no evolution of the\\nabsorber population. We also find that the dN/dz distribution is dominated by\\ngalaxies with HI masses near 10^9 Msolar. However, because of the large\\ndispersion in the correlation between HI mass and stellar luminosity, we find\\nthat the distribution of dN/dz as a function of L_J is fairly flat.\\nAdditionally, we examine the line widths of the HI-selected galaxies and show\\nthat there may be evolution in the kinematics of HI-rich galaxies, but it is\\nnot necessary for the higher redshift population to contain a greater\\nproportion of high mass galaxies than we find locally.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jessica L.

With a 3-sigma detection\\nlimit in optical depth of ~0.01, this is the most sensitive HI absorption\\nsurvey. We detected 126 absorption features most of which also have\\ncorresponding HI emission features in the Leiden Dwingeloo Survey of Galactic\\nneutral Hydrogen. The histogram of random velocities of the absorption features\\nis well-fit by two Gaussians centered at V(lsr) ~ 0 km/s with velocity\\ndispersions of 7.6 +/- 0.3 km/s and 21 +/- 4 km/s respectively. About 20% of\\nthe HI absorption features form the larger velocity dispersion component. The\\nHI absorption features forming the narrow Gaussian have a mean optical depth of\\n0.20 +/- 0.19, a mean HI column density of (1.46 +/- 1.03) X 10^{20} cm^{-2},\\nand a mean spin temperature of 121 +/- 69 K. These HI concentrations can be\\nidentified with the standard HI clouds in the cold neutral medium of the\\nGalaxy. The HI absorption features forming the wider Gaussian have a mean\\noptical depth of 0.04 +/- 0.02, a mean HI column density of (4.3 +/- 3.4) X\\n10^{19} cm^{-2}, and a mean spin temperature of 125 +/- 82 K. The HI column\\ndensities of these fast clouds decrease with their increasing random\\nvelocities. These fast clouds can be identified with a population of clouds\\ndetected so far only in optical absorption and in HI emission lines with a\\nsimilar velocity dispersion. This population of fast clouds is likely to be in\\nthe lower Galactic Halo.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Rekhesh Mohan</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>K. S.

With these data, we now have sensitive HI\\nsearches in 34 of the 36 slow rotators. The aggregate detection rate is 32\\\\%\\n$\\\\pm$ 8\\\\%, consistent with previous work; however, we find two detections with\\nextremely high HI masses, whose gas kinematics are substantially different from\\nwhat was previously known about HI in slow rotators. These two cases (NGC 1222\\nand NGC 4191) broaden the known diversity of HI properties in slow rotators.\\nNGC 1222 is a merger remnant with prolate-like rotation and, if it is indeed\\nprolate in shape, an equatorial gas disc; NGC 4191 has two counterrotating\\nstellar discs and an unusually large HI disc. We comment on the implications of\\nthis disc for the formation of $2\\\\sigma$ galaxies. In general, the HI detection\\nrate, the incidence of relaxed HI discs, and the HI/stellar mass ratios of slow\\nrotators are indistinguishable from those of fast rotators. These broad\\nsimilarities suggest that the HI we are detecting now is unrelated to the\\ngalaxies\\' formation processes and was often acquired after their stars were\\nmostly in place. We also discuss the HI nondetections; some of these galaxies\\nthat are undetected in HI or CO are detected in other tracers (e.g. FIR fine\\nstructure lines and dust). The question of whether there is cold gas in massive\\ngalaxies\\' scoured nuclear cores still needs work. Finally, we discuss an\\nunusual isolated HI cloud with a surprisingly faint (undetected) optical\\ncounterpart.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lisa M.

We propose an empirical model to fit the radial\\nprofile of the HI surface density, an exponential function with a depression\\nnear the center. The radial HI surface density profiles are very homogeneous in\\nthe outer regions of the galaxy; the exponentially declining part of the\\nprofile has a scale-length of $\\\\sim 0.18$ R1, where R1 is the radius where the\\ncolumn density of the HI is 1 M$_{\\\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. This holds for all\\ngalaxies, independent of their stellar or HI mass. The homogenous outer\\nprofiles, combined with the limited range in HI surface density in the\\nnon-exponential inner disk, results in the well-known tight relation between HI\\nsize and HI mass. By comparing the radial profiles of the HI-rich galaxies with\\nthose of the control systems, we deduce that in about half the galaxies, most\\nof the excess gas lies outside the stellar disk, in the exponentially declining\\nouter regions of the HI disk. In the other half, the excess is more centrally\\npeaked. We compare our results with existing smoothed-particle hydrodynamical\\nsimulations and semi-analytic models of disk galaxy formation in a $\\\\Lambda$\\nCold Dark Matter universe. Both the hydro simulations and the semi-analytic\\nmodels reproduce the HI surface density profiles and the HI size-mass relation\\nwithout further tuning of the simulation and model inputs. In the semi-analytic\\nmodels, the universal shape of the outer HI radial profiles is a consequence of\\nthe {\\\\em assumption} that infalling gas is always distributed exponentially.\\nThe conversion of atomic gas to molecular form explains the limited range of HI\\nsurface densities in the inner disk. These two factors produce the tight HI\\nmass-size relation.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jing Wang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jian Fu</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Michael Aumer</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Guinevere Kauffmann</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Gyula I.

This extremely low surface\\nbrightness galaxy was first identified in the ALFALFA survey as an \"(Almost)\\nDark\" object: a clearly extragalactic HI source with no obvious optical\\ncounterpart in existing optical survey data (although faint ultraviolet\\nemission was detected in archival GALEX imaging). Using a combination of data\\nfrom the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\\nArray, we investigate the HI morphology and kinematics at a variety of physical\\nscales. The HI morphology is irregular, reaching only moderate maxima in mass\\nsurface density (peak $\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm HI}\\\\sim 10$ $M_{\\\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). Gas of\\nlower surface brightness extends to large radial distances, with the HI\\ndiameter measured at 4.0$\\\\pm$0.2 kpc inside the 1 $M_{\\\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ level.\\nWe quantify the relationships between HI gas mass surface density and various\\ntypes of star formation by considering GALEX far ultraviolet observations and\\nH$\\\\alpha$ nondetections. We describe Coma P\\'s complex HI kinematics using\\nspatially resolved position-velocity analysis and three-dimensional modeling.\\nBoth methods of analysis suggest that Coma P\\'s kinematics show signatures of\\neither the collision of two HI disks or a significant infall event. Coma P is\\njust consistent (within 3$\\\\sigma$) with the known M$_{\\\\rm HI}$ -- D$_{\\\\rm HI}$\\nscaling relation. It is either too large for its HI mass, has too low an HI\\nmass for its HI size, or the two HI components artificially extend its HI size.\\nComa P lies within the empirical scatter at the faint end of the baryonic\\nTully--Fisher relation, although the complexity of the HI dynamics complicates\\nthe interpretation. The collective HI characteristics of Coma P make it unusual\\namong known galaxies in the nearby universe.

The gas dynamics in IC2554 itself, which is sometimes described as a\\ncolliding pair, are surprisingly regular, whereas NGC3136B was not detected.\\nThe HI cloud, which emerges from IC2554 as a large arc-shaped plume, has a size\\nof about 30 kpc, larger than that of IC2554. The total HI mass of the IC2554\\nsystem is about 2 x 10^9 Msun, a third of which resides in the HI cloud.

The FUV and HI maps\\nshow a stunning spatial correlation out to almost 4 optical radii (r25),\\nroughly the extent of our maps. This underscores that HI traces the gas\\nreservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at least\\nlow level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere HI is observed. Whereas\\nthe average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before\\nleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low\\nHI columns (&lt;2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\\nwhich is not the case within r25. The time for star formation to consume the\\navailable HI, inferred from the ratio of HI to FUV intensity, rises with\\nincreasing radius before leveling off at ~100 Gyr, i.e., many Hubble times,\\nnear ~1.7 r25. Assuming the relatively short H2 depletion times observed in the\\ninner parts of galaxies hold in outer disks, the conversion of HI into bound,\\nmolecular clouds seems to limit star formation in outer galaxy disks. The long\\nconsumption times suggest that most of the extended HI observed in M83 will not\\nbe consumed by in situ star formation. However, even these low star formation\\nrates are enough to expect moderate chemical enrichment in a closed outer disk.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>F.

The HI clouds, which are drawn from\\npublished GALFA-HI and ALFALFA HI survey compact cloud catalogs, are selected\\nto be galaxy candidates based on their spatial compactness and non-association\\nwith known high-velocity cloud complexes or Galactic HI emission. Based on a\\ncomparison of their UV characteristics to those of known dwarf galaxies, half\\n(48%) of the compact HI clouds have at least one potential stellar counterpart\\nwith UV properties similar to those of nearby dwarf galaxies. If galaxies, the\\nstar formation rates, HI masses, and star formation efficiencies of these\\nsystems follow the trends seen for much larger galaxies. The presence of UV\\nemission is an efficient method to identify the best targets for spectroscopic\\nfollow-up, which is necessary to prove that the stars are associated with the\\ncompact HI. Further, searches of this nature help to refine the salient HI\\nproperties of likely dwarfs (even beyond the Local Group). In particular, HI\\ncompact clouds considered to be velocity outliers relative to their neighbor HI\\nclouds have the most significant detection rate of single, appropriate UV\\ncounterparts.

In this paper we focus on the\\nHI properties of the galaxies in the environment of our targeted galaxies. In\\ntotal, we extract 65 galaxies from the WSRT cubes with stellar masses between\\n$10^8M_{\\\\odot}$ and $10^{11}M_{\\\\odot}$. Most of these galaxies are located on\\nthe same HI mass-size relation and \"HI-plane\" as normal spiral galaxies. We\\nfind that companions around HI-rich galaxies tend to be HI-rich as well and to\\nhave larger R90,HI/R50,HI. This suggests a scenario of \"HI conformity\", similar\\nto the colour conformity found by Weinmann et al. (2006): galaxies tend to\\nadopt the HI properties of their neighbours. We visually inspect the outliers\\nfrom the HI mass-size relation and galaxies which are offset from the HI plane\\nand find that they show morphological and kinematical signatures of recent\\ninteractions with their environment. We speculate that these outliers have been\\ndisturbed by tidal or ram-pressure stripping processes, or in a few cases, by\\naccretion events.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Enci Wang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jing Wang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Guinevere Kauffmann</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Gyula I.

One model includes an explicit treatment for\\nthe partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular hydrogen. All models\\nconsidered agree nicely with the measured HI mass function in the local\\nUniverse, with the measured scaling relations between HI and galaxy stellar\\nmass, and with the predicted 2-point correlation function for HI rich galaxies.\\nOne exception is given by one model that predicts very little HI associated\\nwith galaxies in haloes above 10^12 Msun: we argue this is due to a too\\nefficient radio-mode feedback for central galaxies, and to a combination of\\nefficient stellar feedback and instantaneous stripping of hot gas for\\nsatellites. We demonstrate that treatment of satellite galaxies introduces\\nlarge uncertainties at low HI masses. While models assuming non instantaneous\\nstripping of hot gas tend to form satellite galaxies with HI masses slightly\\nsmaller than those of centrals with the same stellar mass, instantaneous gas\\nstripping does not translate necessarily in lower HI masses. In fact, the\\nadopted stellar feedback and star formation affect the satellites too. We\\nanalyze the relation between HI content and spin of simulated haloes: low spin\\nhaloes tend to host HI poor galaxies while high spin haloes are populated by\\ngalaxies in a wide range of HI mass. In our simulations, this is due to a\\ncorrelation between the initial gas disk size and the halo spin.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Anna Zoldan</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Gabriella De Lucia</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lizhi Xie</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Fabio Fontanot</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Michaela Hirschmann</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1093/mnras/stw2901</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw2901\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">20 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS</arxiv:comment>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02042v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02042v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05293v2</id>\\n    <updated>2017-05-31T20:34:53Z</updated>\\n    <published>2017-03-15T17:52:50Z</published>\\n    <title>(Almost) Dark Galaxies in the ALFALFA Survey: Isolated HI Bearing Ultra\\n  Diffuse Galaxies</title>\\n    <summary>  We present a sample of 115 very low optical surface brightness, highly\\nextended, HI-rich galaxies carefully selected from the ALFALFA survey that have\\nsimilar optical absolute magnitudes, surface brightnesses, and radii to\\nrecently discovered \"ultra-diffuse\" galaxies (UDGs).

The\\ncross-correlation of the intensity maps with optical galaxy surveys can\\nmitigate foreground and systematic effects, but has been shown to significantly\\ndepend on galaxy evolution parameters of the HI and the optical sample.\\nPreviously, we have shown that the shot noise of the cross-correlation scales\\nwith the HI content of the optical samples, such that the shot noise estimation\\ninfers the average HI masses of these samples. In this article, we present an\\nadaptive framework for the cross-correlation of HI intensity maps with galaxy\\nsamples using our implementation of the halo model formalism (Murray et al\\n2018, in prep) which utilises the halo occupation distribution of galaxies to\\npredict their power spectra. We compare two HI population models, tracing the\\nspatial halo and the galaxy distribution respectively, and present their auto-\\nand cross-power spectra with an associated galaxy sample. We find that the\\nchoice of the HI model and the distribution of the HI within the galaxy sample\\nhave minor significance for the shape of the auto- and cross-correlations, but\\nhighly impact the measured shot noise amplitude of the estimators, a finding we\\nconfirm with simulations. We demonstrate parameter estimation of the HI halo\\noccupation models and advocate this framework for the interpretation of future\\nexperimental data, with the prospect of determining the HI masses of optical\\ngalaxy samples via the cross-correlation shot noise.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>L.

The\\nDLA has been earlier identified as a low surface brightness galaxy SBS 1543+593\\nat an impact parameter of ~ 400 pc to the QSO line of sight. The extremely low\\nredshift of the absorber allows us to make spatially resolved images of the\\n21cm emission; besides the HI mass, this also enables us to determine the\\nvelocity field of the galaxy and, hence, to estimate its dynamical mass.\\n  We obtain a total HI mass of ~ 1.4x10^9 Msun, considerably smaller than the\\nvalue of M*(HI) determined from blind 21cm emission surveys. This continues the\\ntrend of low HI mass in all low redshift DLAs for which HI emission\\nobservations have been attempted. We also find that the QSO lies behind a\\nregion of low local HI column density in the foreground galaxy. This is\\ninteresting in view of suggestions that DLA samples are biased against high HI\\ncolumn density systems.

In this fashion,\\nI attempt to show that the reason for Goethe\\'s self-assessment of his Theory of\\nColors is less enigmatic than appears from its examination solely as a work of\\nphysics.

We present here\\nthe HI spectra and derived HI parameters for ten objects detected in this pilot\\nprogram. All are massive disk galaxies in the redshift interval 0.17-0.25 (i.e.\\n2-3 Gyr look-back time), with HI masses M_HI=3-8 x 10^10 Msun and high gas mass\\nfractions (HI - to - stellar mass ratios ~10-30%). Our results demonstrate the\\nefficacy of exploiting Arecibo\\'s large collecting area to measure the HI mass\\nand rotational velocity of galaxies above redshift z=0.2. In particular, this\\nsample includes the highest redshift detections of HI emission from individual\\ngalaxies made to date.

The resulting parameter\\nconstraints describe properties like gas richness verses environment.\\nUnfortunately, clustering studies based on individual HI galaxies will be\\nrestricted to the local Universe for the foreseeable future, even with the\\ndeepest HI surveys. Here we discuss how clustering studies of the HI HOD could\\nbe extended to moderate redshift, through observations of fluctuations in the\\ncombined 21cm intensity of unresolved galaxies. In particular we make an\\nanalytic estimate for the clustering of HI in the HOD. Our joint goals are to\\nestimate i) the amplitude of the signal, and ii) the sensitivity of telescopes\\nlike the Australian SKA Pathfinder to HOD parameters. We find that the power\\nspectrum of redshifted 21cm intensity could be used to study the distribution\\nof HI within dark matter halos at z&gt;0.5 where individual galaxies cannot be\\ndetected. In addition to the HOD of HI, the amplitude of the 21cm power\\nspectrum would also yield estimates of the cosmic HI content at epochs between\\nthe local Universe, and redshifts probed by damped Ly-alpha absorbers.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Stuart Wyithe</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Michael J.

The data show that the luminous optical ring\\naround the elliptical body has a bright HI counterpart that shares the\\nkinematical properties of the optical ring. The entire HI structure is twice as\\nlarge as the optical ring and shows a mild warp in its outer regions relative\\nto the inner ring.

The HI sources are ~0.3 and ~1 Mpc away in projected distance, and the\\ncompanion galaxy is also ~1 Mpc away. Our main conclusion is that the HI\\ndetected in Hoag\\'s Object shows no indication that this galaxy has experienced\\na recent (less than ~1 Gyr ago) accretion event. At least one of the two\\nadditional HI detected objects does not have an optical counterpart. One\\npossibility is that this object is an HI filament left over from an interaction\\nshaping Hoag\\'s Object, in which case this interaction must also have occurred\\nat least 1-2 Gyr ago.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Noah Brosch</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Ido Finkelman</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Tom Oosterloo</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Gyula Jozsa</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Alexei Moiseev</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1093/mnras/stt1348</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt1348\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Accepted for publication in MNRAS</arxiv:comment>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6368v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.6368v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"astro-ph.CO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.CO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3953v1</id>\\n    <updated>2013-12-13T21:06:30Z</updated>\\n    <published>2013-12-13T21:06:30Z</published>\\n    <title>Green Bank Telescope observations of low column density HI around NGC\\n  2997 and NGC 6946</title>\\n    <summary>  Observations of ongoing HI accretion in nearby galaxies have only identified\\nabout 10% of the needed fuel to sustain star formation in these galaxies. Most\\nof these observations have been conducted using interferometers and may have\\nmissed lower column density, diffuse, HI gas that may trace the missing 90% of\\ngas. Such gas may represent the so-called \"cold flows\" predicted by current\\ntheories of galaxy formation to have never been heated above the virial\\ntemperature of the dark matter halo. As a first attempt to identify such cold\\nflows around nearby galaxies and complete the census of HI down to N(HI)~10^18\\ncm^-2, I used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to map the\\ncircumgalactic (r &lt; 100-200 kpc) HI environment around NGC 2997 and NGC 6946.\\nThe resulting GBT observations cover a four square degree area around each\\ngalaxy with a 5-sigma detection limit of N(HI)~10^18 cm^-2 over a 20 km/s\\nlinewidth. This project complements absorption line studies, which are\\nwell-suited to the regime of lower N(HI). Around NGC 2997, the GBT HI data\\nreveal an extended HI disk and all of its surrounding gas-rich satellite\\ngalaxies, but no filamentary features. Furthermore, the HI mass as measured\\nwith the GBT is only 7% higher than past interferometric measurements. After\\ncorrecting for resolution differences, the HI extent of the galaxy is 23%\\nlarger at the N(HI)~1.2x10^18 cm^-2 level as measured by the GBT. On the other\\nhand, the HI observations of NGC 6946 reveal a filamentary feature apparently\\nconnecting NGC 6946 with its nearest companions. This HI filament has\\nN(HI)~10^18 cm^-2 and a FWHM of 55+-5 km/s and was invisible in past\\ninterferometer observations. The properties of this filament are broadly\\nconsistent with being a cold flow or debris from a past tidal interaction\\nbetween NGC 6946 and its satellites.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>D.

The strategy can deal with self-absorbing HI gas and the presence of\\nwarps. The method is first tested on a series of models. We demonstrate that\\nfitting optically thin models to real galaxies will lead to an overestimation\\nof the thickness and velocity dispersion, and to a serious underestimation of\\nthe HI face-on column densities. We subsequently fit both self-absorption and\\noptically thin models to the HI data of six edge-on galaxies. In three of these\\nwe have also measured the velocity dispersion. On average 27 \\\\pm 6 % of the\\ntotal HI mass of edge-on galaxies is hidden by self-absorption. This implies\\nthat the HI mass, thickness and velocity dispersion of galaxies is typically\\nunderestimated in the literature.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>S. P. C.

We show that most of\\nthe HI lies within dark matter halos and quantify the average HI mass hosted by\\nhalos of mass M at redshift z. We find that only halos with circular velocities\\nlarger than $\\\\simeq$ 30 km/s contain HI. While the density profiles of HI\\nexhibit a large halo-to-halo scatter, the mean profiles are universal across\\nmass and redshift. The HI in low-mass halos is mostly located in the central\\ngalaxy, while in massive halos is concentrated in the satellites. We show that\\nthe HI and matter density probability distribution functions differ\\nsignificantly. Our results point out that for small halos the HI bulk velocity\\ngoes in the same direction and has the same magnitude as the halo peculiar\\nvelocity, while in large halos differences show up. We find that halo HI\\nvelocity dispersion follows a power-law with halo mass. We find a complicated\\nHI bias, with HI becoming non-linear already at $k=0.3$ h/Mpc at $z\\\\gtrsim3$.\\nOur simulation reproduces the DLAs bias value from observations. We find that\\nthe clustering of HI can be accurately reproduced by perturbative methods. We\\nidentify a new secondary bias, by showing that the clustering of halos depends\\nnot only on mass but also on HI content. We compute the amplitude of the HI\\nshot-noise and find that it is small at all redshifts. We study the clustering\\nof HI in redshift-space, and show that linear theory can explain the ratio\\nbetween the monopoles in redshift- and real-space down to small scales at high\\nredshift. We find that the amplitude of the Fingers-of-God effect is larger for\\nHI than for matter. We point out that accurate 21 cm maps can be created from\\nN-body or approximate simulations rather than full hydrodynamic simulations.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Shy Genel</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Emanuele Castorina</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Andrej Obuljen</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>David N.

These galaxies display a wealth of phenomena in their Hi\\nmorphology, e.g., tails, truncation and warps. These morphological disturbances\\nare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies\\nundergo in this dense cluster environment. To quantify the morphological\\ntransformation of the HI disks, we compute the morphological parameters of CAS,\\nGini, and M20 and our own GM for 51 galaxies in 48 HI column density maps from\\nthe VIVA project. Some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space\\nof relatively low resolution HI data. Truncation of the HI disk can be cleanly\\nidentified via the Concentration parameter (C&lt;1) and Concentration can also be\\nused to identify HI deficient disks (1&lt;C&lt;5). Tidal interaction is typically\\nidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to\\n(optical) images of galaxies. We find that some selection criteria (Gini-M20,\\nAsymmetry, and a modified Concentration-M20) are still applicable for the\\ncoarse (~15\" FWHM) VIVA HI data. The phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonably\\nwell identified using the Gini-M20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tails\\nidentified but with as many contaminants). Ram-pressure does move HI disks into\\nand out of most of our interaction criteria: the ram-pressure sequence\\nidentified by Vollmer et al. (2009) tracks into and out of some of these\\ncriteria (Asymmetry based and the Gini-M20 selections, but not the\\nConcentration-M20 or the GM based ones). Therefore, future searches for\\ninteraction using HI morphologies should take ram-pressure into account as a\\nmechanism to disturb HI disks enough to make them appear as gravitationally\\ninteracting. One mechanism would be to remove all the HI deficient (C&lt;5) disks\\nfrom the sample, as these have undergone more than one HI removal mechanism.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>B. W.

The early-type sample consists of both lenticular\\nand elliptical galaxies in a variety of environments. A range of morphologies\\nand environments were selected in order to give a broader understanding of the\\norigins, distribution, and fate of the cold gas in early-type galaxies. Six of\\nthe eleven galaxies in the sample are detected in both HI and CO. The H$_{2}$\\nto HI mass ratios for this sample range from 0.2-120. The HI morphologies of\\nthe sample are consistent with that of recent HI surveys of early-type galaxies\\nwhich also find a mix of HI morphologies and masses, low HI peak surface\\ndensities, and a lack of HI in early-type galaxies which reside in high density\\nenvironments. The HI-detected galaxies have a wide range of HI masses\\n(1.4$\\\\times10^{6}$ to 1.1$\\\\times10^{10}$ M$_{\\\\odot}$). There does not appear to\\nbe any correlation between the HI mass and morphology (E versus S0). When HI is\\ndetected, it is centrally peaked - there are no central kpc-scale central HI\\ndepressions like those observed for early-type spiral galaxies at similar\\nspatial resolutions and scales. A kinematic comparison between the HI and CO\\nindicates that both cold gas components share the same origin. The primary goal\\nof this and a series of future papers is to better understand the relationship\\nbetween the atomic and molecular gas in early-type galaxies, and to compare the\\nobserved relationships with those of spiral galaxies where this relationship\\nhas been studied in depth.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Danielle M.

The detected HI and CO gas can explain why star formation, as traced by\\nother emission processes, is going on in the inner part of its disk. On the\\nother hand, the entire outer disk, beyond 3.5 kpc radius, shows no HI emission,\\nhas a very red colour and exhibits neither radio continuum nor H-alpha\\nemission. This indicates that the outer part of NGC 3175 is quiescent, i.e. not\\nforming stars at a measurable rate. Its HI deficiency and the small extent of\\nthe HI layer, which is confined to the boundaries of the optically visible\\ndisk, make NGC 3175 a peculiar spiral galaxy. No intergalactic HI gas in the\\nNGC 3175 group was detected in our interferometric observations. Earlier Parkes\\ntelescope single dish HI observations put an upper limit on the amount of\\ndiffuse gas that might have been missed by the interferometer at 2x10^8 M_sun.\\nOn DSS plates no galaxy in the NGC 3175 group of galaxies (Garcia 1993) is\\nclose enough to it and none exhibits disturbances that could indicate a close\\ninteraction which might have led to the stripping of large parts of its HI gas.\\nThus, despite an extensive multi-wavelength investigation, the reason for the\\nunusual absence of HI and star formation activity in the outer disk of NGC 3175\\nremains an intriguing mystery.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Michael Dahlem</name>\\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Sterrewacht Leiden</arxiv:affiliation>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Matthias Ehle</name>\\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">XMM-Newton Science Operations Centre &amp; ESTEC</arxiv:affiliation>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Stuart Ryder</name>\\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Anglo-Australian Observatory</arxiv:affiliation>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1051/0004-6361:20010313</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20010313\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">8 pages, 6 figures, uses aa.cls.

For the more\\nhomogeneous subsample of 48 groups, we found a mean HI deficiency of DefHI = 40\\n(40% of the expected HI for the LBs and morphological types of the member\\ngalaxies). The individual galaxies show larger degrees of deficiency than the\\ngroups globally, DefHI = 0.62 (24% of the expected HI), due in most cases to\\nefficient gas stripping from individual galaxies into the group environment\\nvisible in the VLA maps. The degree of deficiency is found to be similar to the\\ncentral galaxies of Virgo and Coma cluster, and Coma I group, in spite of the\\nsignificantly different characteristics of these environments. Phase\\ntransformation of the HI should explain the deficiency. The detection rate of\\nHCGs at X-ray wavelengths is larger for HI deficient groups. In the\\nevolutionary scenario we propose, the amount of detected HI would decrease\\nfurther with evolution, by continuous tidal stripping and/or heating. The H2\\ncontent also tends to be lower than expected for the galaxies in HI deficient\\ngroups, this may suggest that the HI stripping by frequent tidal interaction\\nbreaks the balance between the disruption of molecular clouds by star formation\\nand the replenishment from the ambient HI.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>L.

In order to understand the origin of physical properties of apparently\\nisolated HI clouds like the VIRGOHI21, we numerically investigate physical\\nproperties of tidal HI debris that were formed by galaxy-galaxy interaction in\\nclusters of galaxies. Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that tidal\\ndebris with total HI masses of $10^8-10^9$ M$_{\\\\odot}$ can have (1) wide HI\\nvelocity widths ($&gt;200$ km s$^{-1}$), (2) a small mass fraction of stars\\n($\\\\sim$10%), and (3) a mean $B$-band surface brightness of the stellar\\ncomponents fainter than 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These results suggest that the\\nVIRGOHI21, which lies at a projected distance of $\\\\sim$ 150 kpc from the\\none-armed, HI-rich spiral galaxy M99 (NGC 4254), is tidal debris. We propose\\nthat the comparison between the simulated and the observed velocity fields of\\nHI clouds allows us to better understand their nature and origin (e.g., whether\\nthey are just tidal debris or ``dark galaxies\\'\\' that have HI gas only and are\\nembedded by dark matter halos). We also discuss the timescales for isolated HI\\ngas to be evaporated by thermal conduction of the hot intracluster gas.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Kenji Bekki</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Baerbel S.

The\\nsurvey has been conducted in a part of the volume containing the nearby Canes\\nVenatici groups of galaxies. The surveyed region covers an area on the sky of\\nabout 86 square degrees and a range in velocity from about -450 to about 1330\\nkm/s. We find 70 sources in the survey by applying an automated searching\\nalgorithm. Two of the detections have not been catalogued previously, but they\\ncan be assigned an optical counterpart, based on visual inspection of the\\nsecond generation Digital Sky Survey images. Only one of the HI detections is\\nwithout an optical counterpart. This object is detected in the vicinity of\\nNGC4822 and it has been already detected in previous HI studies. Nineteen of\\nthe objects have been detected for the first time in the 21-cm emission line in\\nthis survey. The distribution of the HI properties of our detections confirms\\nour ability to find low mass objects. 86% of the detections have profile widths\\nless than 130 km/s and can be considered dwarf galaxy candidates. The HI fluxes\\nmeasured imply that this survey goes about 10 times deeper than any previous\\nblind HI survey. The HI mass function and the optical properties of the\\ndetected sources will be discussed in future papers.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>K.

By systematically assessing the link\\nbetween HI and star formation within a sample of galaxies with extremely high\\nHI masses (log M_HI/M_sun &gt; 10), we uncover a population of galaxies with an\\nunexpected combination of high HI masses and low specific star formation rates\\nthat exists primarily at stellar masses greater than log M_*/M_sun ~ 10.5. We\\nobtained HI maps of 20 galaxies in this population to understand the\\ndistribution of the HI and the physical conditions in the galaxies that could\\nbe suppressing star formation in the presence of large quantities of HI.

In these analyses, the 21-cm HI emission is usually assumed to be\\ncompletely optically thin. We have reanalyzed the HI emission from the whole\\nsky at |b|&gt;15 degree by considering temperature stratification in the ISM\\ninferred from the Planck/IRAS analysis of the dust properties. The results\\nindicate that the HI emission is saturated with an optical depth ranging from\\n0.5 to 3 for 85% of the local HI gas. This optically thick HI is characterized\\nby spin temperature in the range 10K-60K, significantly lower than previously\\npostulated in the literature, whereas such low temperature is consistent with\\nemission/absorption measurements of the cool HI toward radio continuum sources.\\nThe distribution and the column density of the HI are consistent with those of\\nthe dark gas sug- gested by gamma-rays, and it is possible that the dark gas in\\nthe Galaxy is dominated by optically thick cold HI gas.

We analyze outer (R&gt;1.5 Re) stellar\\npopulations for a subset of face-on systems using optical g-r versus r-z\\ncolour/colour diagrams. The results are compared with those from control\\nsamples that are defined without regard to atomic gas content, but are matched\\nin redshift, stellar mass and structural parameters. HI-rich early-type (C&gt;2.6)\\nand late-type (C&lt;2.6) galaxies are studied separately. When compared to the\\ncontrol sample, the outer stellar populations of the majority of HI-rich\\nearly-type galaxies are shifted in the colour/colour plane along a locus\\nconsistent with younger stellar ages, but similar metallicities. The outer\\ncolours of HI-rich late-type galaxies are much bluer in r-z than the HI-rich\\nearly types, and we infer that they have outer disks which are both younger and\\nmore metal-poor. We then proceed to analyze the galaxy environments of HI-rich\\ngalaxies on scales of 500 kpc. HI-rich early-type galaxies with low (log M* &lt;\\n10.5) stellar masses differ significantly from the control sample in that they\\nare more likely to be central rather than satellite systems. Their satellites\\nare also less massive and have younger stellar populations. Similar, but weaker\\neffects are found for low mass HI-rich late-type galaxies. In addition, we find\\nthat the satellites of HI-rich late-types exhibit a greater tendency to align\\nalong the major axis of the primary.

In particular,\\nwe use a previously calibrated optical HOD describing the luminosity- and\\ncolour-dependent clustering of SDSS galaxies and describe the HI content using\\na statistical scaling relation between the optical properties and HI mass. This\\nallows us to compute the abundance and clustering properties of HI-selected\\ngalaxies and compare with data from the ALFALFA survey. We apply an MCMC-based\\nstatistical analysis to constrain the free parameters related to the scaling\\nrelation. The resulting best-fit scaling relation identifies massive HI\\ngalaxies primarily with optically faint blue centrals, consistent with\\nexpectations from galaxy formation models. We compare the HI-stellar mass\\nrelation predicted by our model with independent observations from matched\\nHI-optical galaxy samples, finding reasonable agreement. As a further\\napplication, we make some preliminary forecasts for future observations of HI\\nand optical galaxies in the expected overlap volume of SKA and Euclid/LSST.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Niladri Paul</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Tirthankar Roy Choudhury</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Aseem Paranjape</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1093/mnras/sty1539</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty1539\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">12 pages, 11 figures, v2: substantial revision, matches accepted\\n  version</arxiv:comment>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04469v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04469v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.GA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.CO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06636v1</id>\\n    <updated>2017-12-18T19:30:31Z</updated>\\n    <published>2017-12-18T19:30:31Z</published>\\n    <title>Deep neutral hydrogen observations of Leo T with the Westerbork\\n  Synthesis Radio Telescope</title>\\n    <summary>  Leo T is the lowest mass gas-rich galaxy currently known and studies of its\\ngas content help us understand how such marginal galaxies survive and form\\nstars. We present deep neutral hydrogen (HI) observations from the Westerbork\\nSynthesis Radio Telescope in order to understand its HI distribution and\\npotential for star formation. We find a larger HI line flux than the previously\\naccepted value, resulting in a 50% larger HI mass of 4.1 x 10^5 Msun. The\\nadditional HI flux is from low surface brightness emission that was previously\\nmissed; with careful masking this emission can be recovered even in shallower\\ndata. We perform a Gaussian spectral decomposition to find a cool neutral\\nmedium component (CNM) with a mass of 3.7 x 10^4 Msun, or almost 10% of the\\ntotal HI mass. Leo T has no HI emission extending from the main HI body, but\\nthere is evidence of interaction with the Milky Way circumgalactic medium in\\nboth a potential truncation of the HI body and the offset of the peak HI\\ndistribution from the optical center. The CNM component of Leo T is large when\\ncompared to other dwarf galaxies, even though Leo T is not currently forming\\nstars and has a lower star formation efficiency than other gas-rich dwarf\\ngalaxies. However, the HI column density associated with the CNM component in\\nLeo T is low. One possible explanation is the large CNM component is not\\nrelated to star formation potential but rather a recent, transient phenomenon\\nrelated to the interaction of Leo T with the Milky Way circumgalactic medium.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Elizabeth A.

We used new VLA HI observations combined with AGES single dish\\nblind survey data. Our study indicates that the asymmetry between the high-and\\nlow-velocity wings of the characteristic double-horn integrated HI spectrum as\\nmeasured by the asymmetry parameter, Aflux, can be a useful diagnostic for\\nongoing and/or recent HI stripping. 26% of A1367 LTGs have an Aflux ratio, more\\nasymmetrical than 3 times the 1{\\\\sigma} spread in the Aflux ratio distribution\\nof an undisturbed sample of isolated galaxies (2%) and samples from other\\ndenser environments (10% to 20%). Over half of the A 1367 LTGs, which are\\nmembers of groups or pairs, have an Aflux ratio larger than twice the 1\\n{\\\\sigma} spread found in the isolated sample. This suggests inter-group/pair\\ninteractions could be making a significant contribution to the LTGs displaying\\nsuch Aflux ratios. The study also demonstrates that the definition of the HI\\noffset from the optical centre of LTGs is resolution dependent, suggesting that\\nunresolved AGES HI offsets that are significantly larger than the pointing\\nuncertainties (&gt; 2 {\\\\sigma}) reflect interactions which have asymmetrically\\ndisplaced significant masses of lower density HI, while having minimal impact\\non the location of the highest density HI in resolved maps. The distribution of\\nAflux from a comparable sample of Virgo galaxies provides a clear indication\\nthat the frequency of HI profile perturbations is lower than in A 1367.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>T.

We detect HI within the primary beam (30\\' HPBW) in\\nfour of the five systems. However, in only one case is this gas associated with\\nthe targeted elliptical galaxy. In the other cases the HI is associated with a\\nnearby gas-rich disk or dwarf galaxy. The one HI detection is for NGC 7626,\\nwhere we tentatively detect an HI cloud lying between 20 and 40 kpc southwest\\nof the galaxy center. Its origin is unclear. Our failure to detect obvious\\ntidal HI features suggests that if these fine-structure ellipticals are\\nremnants of disk galaxy mergers, either the progenitors were gas poor, or they\\nare well evolved and any gaseous tidal features have dispersed and/or been\\nconverted into other phases. Our targeted systems all reside in groups or\\nclusters, and it seems likely that tidal HI is shorter lived in these\\nenvironments than suggested by studies of more isolated merger remnants.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>J.

Such\\ncavities are seen as HI holes when observed in face-on galaxies. Gas\\nhydrodynamics simulations are performed to obtain the quantitative\\ncharacteristics of HI holes that could serve for the determination of the gas\\nvertical scale height and the corresponding dark matter content and its\\ndistribution. Among these characteristics is the ratio of the maximum column\\ndensity in the HI ring surrounding the hole to the background HI column density\\nand the vertical expansion velocity of gas in the HI ring.

The visibility correlations\\ndirectly probe the power spectrum of HI fluctuations at the epoch when the HI\\nemission originated, and this holds the possibility of using HI observations to\\nstudy large-scale structures at high z.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Somnath Bharadwaj</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Pennathur Sridharan Srikant</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1007/BF02702289</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02702289\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Submitted to JApA, 12 Latex pages including 6 figures</arxiv:comment>\\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">J.Astrophys.Astron. 25 (2004) 67</arxiv:journal_ref>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402262v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0402262v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"astro-ph\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504229v1</id>\\n    <updated>2005-04-10T13:50:05Z</updated>\\n    <published>2005-04-10T13:50:05Z</published>\\n    <title>Triggering and Feedback: The Relation between the HI Gas and the\\n  Starburst in the Dwarf Galaxy NGC 1569</title>\\n    <summary>  As part of our study on the impact of violent star formation on the\\ninterstellar medium (ISM) of dwarf galaxies, we report observations of neutral\\natomic hydrogen (HI) in the post-starburst dwarf galaxy NGC 1569.\\nHigh-resolution measurements with the VLA (B-, C- and D-array) are aimed at\\nidentifying morphological and kinematical signatures in the HI caused by the\\nstarburst. Our kinematical data suggest a huge hole in the HI distribution,\\nprobably due to the large number of supernovae explosions in the center of the\\ngalaxy over the past 20 Myr. Investigating the large-scale HI structure, we\\nconfirm the existence of a possible HI companion and a so-called HI bridge east\\nof NGC 1569. Furthermore, we report the detection of additional low-intensity\\nHI halo emission, which leads us to suggest a revised halo structure. Based on\\nthe new picture, we discuss the origin of the halo gas and possible\\nimplications for the evolution of the starburst in NGC 1569.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>S.

For HI galaxies (1000&lt;vel&lt;6000\\nkm\\\\s) there is no significant change in the star formation rate or the\\nefficiency of star formation with respect to local surface density.

His\\nattempts ultimately proved fruitless and he was unfortunately partially shunned\\nby some physicists in the latter portion of his career.

Though the work was ultimately not fruitful, in\\nhindsight it did foreshadow several later results in physics and his methods\\nwere definitely rigorous. In addition, his philosophy regarding determinism and\\nuncertainty was actually fairly orthodox for his time.

He discovered, along with one of his\\nstudents, Georg Pfotzer, the altitude at which the production of ionisation in\\nthe atmosphere reaches a maximum, often, but misleadingly, called the Pfotzer\\nmaximum. Regener was one of the first to estimate the energy density of cosmic\\nrays, an estimate that was used by Baade and Zwicky to bolster their postulate\\nthat supernovae might be their source. Yet Regener\\'s name is less recognised by\\npresent-day cosmic ray physicists than it should be largely because in 1937 he\\nwas forced to take early retirement by the National Socialists as his wife had\\nJewish ancestors. In this paper we briefly review his work on cosmic rays and\\nrecommend an alternative naming of the ionisation maximum. The influence that\\nRegener had on the field through his son, his son-in-law, his grandsons and his\\nstudents and through his links with Rutherford\\'s group in Cambridge is\\ndiscussed in an appendix.

At each step\\nof the process, a listener is persuaded by his/her neighbour, the lobbyist, to\\nmodify his/her opinion on two different choices of event. Whether or not the\\nlistener will be convinced by the lobbyist depends on the difference between\\nhis/her opinion with that of the lobbyist, and with that of the revealed social\\nopinion (the social pressure). If the listener is convinced, he/she will modify\\nhis/her opinion and update his/her revealed preference, and proceed to persuade\\nhis/her next neighbour. If the listener is not convinced by the lobbyist,\\nhe/she will retain his/her revealed preference, and try to persuade the\\nlobbyist to change his/her opinion. In this case, the direction of opinion\\npropagation is reversed. A consensus is reached when all the revealed\\npreference is the same. Our numerical results show that consensus can always be\\nattained in this model. However, the time needed to achieve consensus, or the\\nso-called convergence time, is longer if the listener is more concerned with\\nthe public opinion, or is less likely to be influenced by the lobbyist.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>C. -I.

       "'  in this manuscript we present a brief life history of ludwig edward boltzmann and his achivements. particularly, we discuss his h-theorem, his work on entropy and statistical interpretation of second-law of thermodynamics. we point out his some other contributions in physics, characteristics of his work, his strong support on atomism, character of his personality and relationship with his students and final part of his life. \\n  we investigate the properties of hi-rich galaxies detected in blind radio surveys within the hierarchical structure formation scenario using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. by drawing a detailed comparison between the properties of hi-selected galaxies and hi absorption systems, we argue a link between the local galaxy population and quasar absorption systems, particularly for damped ly-alpha absorption (dla) systems and sub-dla systems. first, we evaluate how many hi-selected galaxies exhibit hi column densities as high as those of dla systems. we find that hi-selected galaxies with hi masses m(hi) &gt; 10^8 solar masses have gaseous disks that produce hi column densities comparable to those of dla systems. we conclude that dla galaxies where the hi column densities are as high as those of dla systems, contribute significantly to the population of hi-selected galaxies at m(hi) &gt; 10^8 solar masses. second, we find that star formation rates (sfrs) correlate tightly with hi masses rather than b- (and j-) band luminosities.   in the low-mass range m(hi) &lt; 10^8 solar masses, sub-dla galaxies replace dla galaxies as the dominant population. the number fraction of sub-dla galaxies relative to galaxies reaches 40%-60% at hi masses 10^8 solar masses and 30%-80% at 10^7 solar masses. the hi-selected galaxies at 10^7 solar masses are a strong probe of sub-dla systems that place stringent constraints on galaxy formation and evolution. \\n  we have conducted the first blind hi survey covering 480 deg^2 and a heliocentric velocity range from 300-1900 kms to investigate the hi content of the nearby spiral-rich ursa major region and to look for previously uncatalogued gas-rich objects. here we present the catalog of hi sources. the hi data were obtained with the 4-beam receiver mounted on the 76.2-m lovell telescope (fwhm 12 arcmin) at the jodrell bank observatory (uk) as part of the hi jodrell all sky survey (hijass). we use the automated source finder duchamp and identify 166 hi sources in the data cubes with hi masses in the range of 10^7 - 10^{10.5} m_sun. our ursa major hi catalogue includes 10 first time detections in the 21-cm emission line.   we identify optical counterparts for 165 hi sources (99 per cent). for 54 hi sources (33 per cent) we find numerous optical counterparts in the hijass beam, indicating a high density of galaxies and likely tidal interactions. four of these hi systems are discussed in detail.   we find only one hi source (1 per cent) without a visible optical counterpart out of the 166 hi detections. green bank telescope (fwhm 9 arcmin) follow-up observations confirmed this hi source and its hi properties. the nature of this detection is discussed and compared to similar sources in other hi surveys. \\n  hi kinematic asymmetries are common in late-type galaxies irrespective of environment, although the amplitudes are strikingly low in isolated galaxies. as part of our studies of the hi morphology and kinematics in isolated late-type galaxies we have chosen several very isolated galaxies from the amiga sample for hi mapping. here we present gmrt 21-cm hi line mapping of cig 340 which was selected because its integrated hi spectrum has a very symmetric profile, aflux = 1.03. optical images of the galaxy hinted at a warped disk in contrast to the symmetric integrated hi spectrum profile. our aim is to determine the extent to which the optical asymmetry is reflected in the resolved hi morphology and kinematics. gmrt observations reveal significant hi morphological asymmetries in cig 340 despite it\\'s overall symmetric optical form and highly symmetric hi spectrum. the most notable hi features are: 1) a warp in the hi disk (with an optical counterpart), 2) the hi northsouth flux ratio = 1.32 is much larger than expected from the integrated hi spectrum profile and 3) a ~ 45\" (12 kpc) hi extension, containing ~ 6% of the detected hi mass on the northern side of the disk. we conclude that in isolated galaxies a highly symmetric hi spectrum can mask significant hi morphological asymmetries. the northern hi extension appears to be the result of a recent perturbation (10^8 yr), possibly by a satellite which is now disrupted or projected within the disk. this study provides an important step in our ongoing program to determine the predominant source of hi asymmetries in isolated galaxies. for cig 340 the isolation from major companions, symmetric hi spectrum, optical morphology and interaction timescales have allowed us to narrow the possible causes the hi asymmetries and identify tests to further constrain the source of the asymmetries. \\n  in the patent office einstein hatched his most beautiful ideas, and there he spent his \"happy bern years\". these wonderful ideas led to his miraculous year works of 1905. einstein was not an expert in academic matters, and he was out of academic world. neither did he meet influential professors, or attend academic meetings. he discussed his ideas with his close friends and colleagues from the patent office. in 1907 he finally got his foot into the academic doorway; einstein became a privatdozent and gave lectures at the university of bern. however, his first students consisted again of his two close friends and another colleague from the patent office. \\n  we present new multi-wavelength scaling relations between the neutral hydrogen content (hi) and the stellar properties of nearby galaxies selected from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass). we use these new scaling relations to investigate the environmental dependency of the hi content of galaxies. we find that galaxies in high density environments tend to have on average less hi than galaxies with the same stellar mass in the low density environment. our new hi scaling relations allow us to identify individual galaxies, as well as groupcluster environments, that have an `anomalous\\' hi content. we map the global distribution of hi-deficient and hi-excess galaxies on the sky and compare it to the large scale structure of galaxies. we find galaxy clusters to be hi-deficient, and we identify that the regions surrounding clusters tend to be hi-excess. finally, we demonstrate the potential of using hi scaling relations to predict future hi surveys based on an optical redshift survey. we apply our scaling relations to 16709 galaxies in the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs) that lie in the hipass volume and compare our predictions to the measurements. we find that scaling relations are good method to estimate the outcome of hi surveys. \\n  the neutral hydrogen (hi) gas is an important barometer of recent star formation and metal enrichment activities in galaxies. we develop a novel statistical method for predicting the hi-to-stellar mass ratio f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}} of galaxies from their stellar mass and optical colour, and apply it to a volume-limited galaxy sample jointly observed by the sloan digital sky survey and the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey. we eliminate the impact of the malmquist bias against hi-deficient systems on the f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}} predictor by properly accounting for the hi detection probability of each galaxy in the analysis. the best-fitting f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}} predictor, with an estimated scatter of 0.272 dex, provides excellent description to the observed hi mass function. after defining an hi excess parameter as the deviation of the observed f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}} from the expected value, we confirm that there exists a strong secondary dependence of the mass-metallicity relation on hi excess. by further examining the 2d metallicity distribution on the specific star formation rate vs. hi excess plane, we demonstrate that the metallicity dependence on hi is more fundamental than that on specific star formation rate. in addition, we show that the environmental dependence of hi in the local universe can be effectively described by the cross-correlation coefficient between hi excess and the red galaxy overdensity \\\\rho_{cc}{=}-0.18. this weak anti-correlation also successfully explains the observed dependence of hi clustering on f_{\\\\mathrm{gas}}. our method provides a useful framework for learning hi gas evolution from the synergy between future hi and optical galaxy surveys. \\n  we derived the three-dimensional distribution of hi gas in the milky way galaxy using the latest hi survey data cubes and rotation curves. the distance of the hi gas was determined by the kinematic distance using a rotation curve. we solved the near-far problem in the inner galaxy by a fitting method which involves introducing a model of vertical hi distribution.   in our resultant maps we could trace three prominent arms: the sagittarius-carina arm, the perseus arm, and the outer arm. these three arms were found to be logarithmic spiral arms. the pitch angles of the sagittarius-carina, perseus, and outer arms were estimated to be about 11\\\\arcdeg, 18\\\\arcdeg, and 7\\\\arcdeg, respectively. the sun is located in a region rich in hi gas between the sagittarius-carina arm and the perseus arm.   the hi disk shows large and asymmetric warping in the outer disk: the hi disk goes up to about 1.5 kpc above the galactic plane in the northern hemisphere, and down to about 1 kpc in the southern hemisphere, which means asymmetric warping. the inner hi disk is also found to be tilting. the radius of the hi disk is about 17 kpc and the hi mass within this radius is estimated to be 2.5 \\\\times 10^9 m_\\\\odot, which corresponds to 1.5 % of the dynamical mass predicted from the rotation curve. we also found that the hi outskirt is largely swelling in the fourth quadrant, and hence the galaxy is significantly lopsided. the scale-height of the hi layer increases with the radius, and is correlated with the hi volume density at the centroid of the hi layer. \\n  it is well established that mgii absorption lines detected in background quasar spectra arise from gas structures associated with foreground galaxies. the degree to which galaxy evolution is driven by the gas cycling through halos is highly uncertain because their gas mass density is poorly constrained. fitting the mgii equivalent width (w) distribution with a schechter function and applying the n(hi)-w correlation of menard &amp; chelouche, we computed omega(hi)_mgii ~ omega(hi)_halo =(1.41 +0.75 -0.44)x10^-4 for 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.4. we exclude dlas from our calculations so that omega(hi)_halo comprises accreting andor outflowing halo gas not locked up in cold neutral clouds. we deduce the cosmic hi gas mass density fraction in galactic halos traced by mgii absorption is omega(hi)_haloomega(hi)_dla=15% and omega(hi)_haloomega_b=0.3%. citing several lines of evidence, we propose infallaccretion material is sampled by small w whereas outflowwinds are sampled by large w, and find omega(hi)_infall is consistent with omega(hi)_outflow for bifurcation at w=1.23^{+0.15}_{-0.28}\\\\aa; cold accretion would then comprise no more than ~7% of of the total hi mass density. we discuss evidence that (1) the total hi mass cycling through halos remains fairly constant with cosmic time and that the accretion of hi gas sustains galaxy winds, and (2) evolution in the cosmic star formation rate depends primarily on the rate at which cool hi gas cycles through halos. \\n  hi shells, which may be formed by the activity of young and massive stars, or connected to energy released by interactions of high-velocity clouds with the galactic disk, may be partly responsible both for the destruction of co clouds and for the creation of others. it is not known which effect prevails. we study the relation between hi shells and co in the outer parts of the milky way, using hi and co surveys and a catalogue of previously identified hi shells. for each individual location, the distance to the nearest hi shell is calculated and it is specified whether it lies in the interior of an hi shell, in its walls, or outside an hi shell. the method takes into account irregular shapes of hi shells. we find a lack of co clouds in the interiors of hi shells and their increased occurrence in walls. properties of clouds differ for different environments: interiors of hi shells, their walls, and unperturbed medium. co clouds found in the interiors of hi shells are those that survived and were robbed of their more diffuse gas. walls of hi shells have a high molecular content, indicative of an increased rate of co formation. comparing the co fractions within hi shells and outside in the unperturbed medium, we conclude that hi shells are responsible for approx. 20 % increase in the total amount of co in the outer milky way. \\n  we have investigated the distribution and evolution of ~3100 intergalactic hi absorbers with hi column densities log n(hi) = [12.75, 17.0] at 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.2, using 18 high resolution, high sn quasar spectra obtained from the eso vltuves archive. we used two sets of voigt profile fitting analysis, one including all the available high-order lyman lines to obtain reliable hi column densities of saturated lines, and another using only the ly-alpha lines. there is no significant difference between the results from the two fits. combining our results with literature data, the mean number density at 0 &lt; z &lt; 4 is not well described by a single power law and strongly suggests that its evolution slows down at z &lt; 1.5 at the high and low column density ranges. we also divided our entire hi absorbers at 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 into two samples, the unenriched forest and the civ-enriched forest, depending on whether hi lines are associated with civ at log n(civ) &gt; 12.2 within a given velocity range. the entire hi column density distribution function (cddf) can be described as the combination of these two well-characterised populations which overlap at log n(hi) ~ 15. at log n(hi) &lt; 15, the unenriched forest dominates, showing a similar power-law distribution to the entire forest. the civ-enriched forest dominates at log n(hi) &gt; 15, with its distribution function proportional to n(hi)^(-1.45). however, it starts to flatten out at lower n(hi), since the enriched forest fraction decreases with decreasing n(hi). the deviation from the power law at log n(hi) = [14, 17] shown in the cddf for the entire hi sample is a result of combining two different hi populations with a different cddf shape. the total hi mass density relative to the critical density is omega(hi) ~ 1.6 x 10^(-6) h^(-1), where the enriched forest accounts for ~40% of omega(hi). \\n  we introduce the \"bluedisk\" project, a large program at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) that has mapped the hi in a sample of 23 nearby galaxies with unusually high hi mass fractions, along with a similar-sized sample of control galaxies matched in stellar mass, size, inclination and redshift. this paper presents the sample selection, observational set-up, data reduction strategy, and a first analysis of the sizes and structural properties of the hi disks. we find that the hi-rich galaxies lie on the same hi mass versus hi size relation as normal spiral galaxies, extending it to total hi masses of 2 \\\\times 10^{10} m_{\\\\odot} and radii r1 of \\\\sim 100 kpc (where r1 is defined as the radius where the hi column density reaches 1 m_{\\\\odot} pc^{-2}). hi-rich galaxies have significantly larger values of hi-to-optical size ratio at fixed stellar mass, concentration index, stellar and star formation rate surface density compared to the control sample. the disks of hi-rich galaxies are also significantly more clumpy (i.e. have higher hi gini and \\\\deltaarea coefficient) than those of normal spirals. there is no evidence that the disks of hi-rich galaxies are more disturbed: hi-rich galaxies exhibit no difference with respect to control samples in their distributions of hi asymmetry indices or opticalhi disk position angle differences. in fact, the center of the hi distribution corresponds more closely with the center of the optical light in the hi-rich galaxies than in the controls. all these results argue against a scenario in which new gas has been brought in by mergers. it is possible that they may be more consistent with cooling from a surrounding quasi-static halo of warmhot gas. \\n  recent observations have discovered a giant hi bridge that appears to connect between the outer halo regions of m31 and m33. we propose that this hi bridge can be formed as a result of the past interaction between m31 and m33 based on test particle simulations with different orbits of m31 and m33 for the last ~ 9 gyr. we show that strong tidal interaction between m31 and m33 about 4-8 gyr ago can strip hi gas from m33 to form hi streams around m31 which can be observed as a hi bridge if they are projected onto the sky. we show that the number fraction of models reproducing well the observed hi distribution of the bridge is only ~0.01% (i.e., ~10 among ~10^5 models) and thus suggest that the observed structure and kinematics of the hi bridge can give some constraints on the past orbits of m31 and m33. we suggest that the observed outer hi warp in m33 could be fossil evidence for the past m31-m33 interaction. we also suggest that some of high velocity clouds (hvcs) recently found in m31 could be hi gas originating from m33. we briefly discuss other possible scenarios for the formation of the hi bridge. \\n  we briefly review some of ramanujan\\'s contributions to mathematics, including his 1\\\\pi series, his work on modular forms, and his work on partitions. we briefly review his life, including his collaboration with hardy. finally, we give a brief summary of what any prospective mathematician should know about ramanujan\\'s work in number theory, including the rich relationship between his work on partitions and his work on modular forms. the title of this paper is a reference to a direct quote from ramanujan himself: an equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of god. \\n  we present wsrt observations of high sensitivity and resolution of the neutral hydrogen in the starburst dwarf galaxy ngc 1569. assuming a distance of 2.2 mpc, we find a total hi mass of 1.3 * 10^8 m_sun to be distributed in the form of a dense, clumpy ridge surrounded by more extended diffuse hi containing a few additional discrete features, such as a western hi arm and an hi bridge reaching out to a small counterrotating companion cloud. about 10% by mass of all hi in ngc 1569 is at unusually high velocities. some of this hi may be associated with the mass outflow evident from h-alpha measurements, but some may also be associated with ngc 1569\\'s hi companion and intervening hi bridge, in which case, infall rather than outflow might be the cause of the discrepant velocities. no indication of a large bubble structure was found in position-velocity maps of the high-velocity hi. the galaxy as a whole is in modest overall rotation, but the hi gas lacks any sign of rotation within 60\\'\\' (0.6 kpc) from the center, i.e. over most of the optical galaxy. here, turbulent motions resulting from the starburst appear to dominate over rotation. in the outer disk, the rotational velocities reach a maximum of 35 \\\\pm 6 kms, but turbulent motion remains significant. thus, starburst effects are still noticeable in the outer hi disk, although they are no longer dominant beyond 0.6 kpc. even excluding the most extreme high-velocity hi clouds, ngc 1569 still has an unusually high mean hi velocity dispersion of sigma_v=21.3 kms, more than double that of other dwarf galaxies. \\n  the gmrt hi 21cm-line observations of galaxies in the eridanus group are presented. the eridanus group, at a distance of ~23 mpc, is a loose group of \\\\~200 galaxies. the group extends more than 10 mpc in projection. the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the group is ~240 kms. the galaxies are clustered into different sub-groups. the overall population mix of the group is 30% (e+s0) and 70% (sp+irr). the observations of 57 eridanus galaxies were carried out with the gmrt for ~200 hour. hi emission was detected from 31 galaxies. the channel rms of ~1.0 mjy beam^{-1} was achieved for most of the image-cubes made with 4 hour of data. the corresponding hi column density sensitivity (3-sigma) is ~1x10^{20} cm^{-2} for a velocity-width of ~13.4 kms. the 3-sigma detection limit of hi mass is ~1.2x10^{7} m_sun for a line-width of 50 kms. total hi images, hi velocity fields, global hi line profiles, hi mass surface densities, hi disk parameters and hi rotation curves are presented. the velocity fields are analysed separately for the approaching and the receding sides of the galaxies. this data will be used to study the hi and the radio continuum properties, the tully-fisher relations, the dark matter halos, and the kinematical and hi lopsidedness in galaxies. \\n  in order to investigate the contribution of diffuse components to their total hi emission, we have obtained high precision hi line flux densities with the 100m green bank telescope for a sample of 100 isolated spiral and irregular galaxies which we have previously observed with the 43m telescope. a comparison of the observed hi line fluxes obtained with the two different telescopes, characterized by half-power beam widths of 9 arcmin and 21 arcmin respectively, exploits a ``beam matching\\'\\' technique to yield a statistical determination of the occurrence of diffuse hi components in their disks. a simple model of the hi distribution within a galaxy well describes ~75 % of the sample and accounts for all of the hi line flux density. the remaining galaxies are approximately evenly divided into two categories: ones which appear to possess a significantly more extensive hi distribution than the model predicts, and ones for which the hi distribution is more centrally concentrated than predicted. examples of both extremes can be found in the literature but little attention has been paid to the centrally concentrated hi systems. our sample has demonstrated that galaxies do not commonly possess extended regions of low surface brightness hi gas which is not accounted for by our current understanding of the structure of hi disks. eight hi-rich companions to the target objects are identified, and a set of extragalactic hi line flux density calibrators is presented. \\n  a study is presented of hi line observations of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 3521 observed with the vla as part of the hi nearby galaxy survey. clearly evident in the hi data cube is the presence of an anomalous hi component that is both diffuse and slow-rotating. the data cube is dynamically decomposed into regular and anomalous hi components. a mass of m_hi=1.5 x 10^9 msun is estimated for the anomalous hi - 20 per cent of the total hi mass. standard hi data products and rotation curves are produced for each dynamical component. in terms of circular rotation speed, the anomalous hi is found to lag the regular hi by ~25 - 125 kms. three-dimensional models are generated and used to determine the possible location of the anomalous hi. the results strongly suggest it to be distributed in a thick disc with a scale-height of a few kpc (~3.5 kpc). it is concluded that the anomalous hi in ngc 3521 constitutes a slow-rotating halo gas component, consistent with similar findings for other nearby galaxies. a study of the radial distribution of the anomalous hi shows it to be spatially coincident with the inner regions of the stellar disc where the star formation rate is highest. it is most likely a galactic fountain that has deposited gas from the disc of the galaxy into the halo. \\n  in this paper, we report the peculiar hi morphology of the cluster spiral galaxy ngc 6145, which has a 150 kpc hi filament on one side that is nearly parallel to its major axis. this filament is made up of several hi clouds and the diffuse hi gas between them, with no optical counterparts. we compare its hi distribution with other one-sided hi distributions in the literature, and find that the overall hi distribution is very different from the typical tidal and ram-pressure stripped hi shape, and its morphology is inconsistent with being a pure accretion event. only about 30% of the total hi gas is anchored on the stellar disk, while most of hi gas forms the filament in the west. at a projected distance of 122 kpc, we find a massive elliptical companion (ngc 6146) with extended radio emission, whose axis points to an hi gap in ngc 6145. the velocity of the hi filament shows an overall light-of- sight motion of 80 to 180 kms with respect to ngc 6145. using the long-slit spectra of ngc 6145 along its major stellar axis, we find that some outer regions show enhanced star formation, while in contrast, almost no star formation activities are found in its center (less than 2 kpc). pure accretion, tidal or ram-pressure stripping is not likely to produce the observed hi filament. an alternative explanation is the jet-stripping from ngc 6146, although direct evidence for a jet-cold gas interaction has not been found. \\n  wolfgang pauli\\'s philosophy and physics were intertwined. his philosophy was a variety of platonism, in which pauli\\'s affiliation with carl jung formed an integral part, but pauli\\'s philosophical explorations in physics appeared before he met jung. jung validated pauli\\'s psycho-philosophical perspective. thus, the roots of pauli\\'s physics and philosophy are important in the history of modern physics. in his early physics, pauli attempted to ground his theoretical physics in positivism. he then began instead to trust his intuitive visualizations of entities that formed an underlying reality to the sensible physical world. these visualizations included holistic kernels of mathematical-physical entities that later became for him synonymous with jung\\'s mandalas. i have connected pauli\\'s visualization patterns in physics during the period 1900 to 1930 to the psychological philosophy of jung and displayed some examples of pauli\\'s creativity in the development of quantum mechanics. by looking at pauli\\'s early physics and philosophy, we gain insight into pauli\\'s contributions to quantum mechanics. his exclusion principle, his influence on werner heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm logical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron spinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum physicists, all point to pauli being the dominant genius in the development of quantum theory. because pauli was in a difficult individuation process during his early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often contradictory. my analysis of pauli\\'s physics and philosophy is based upon published and unpublished sources, and pauli\\'s later reflections. a pattern has emerged. pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and empiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. this coupled with disturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led pauli to seek treatment at the jung clinic. pauli\\'s psychological tension diminished after 1932. his physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. his philosophy allied with jung\\'s resembled a platonism of combined psyche and physics. pauli sought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58. \\n  we summarize the hi properties of early-type galaxies, in particular the differences in hi morphologies observed in early-type galaxies of different luminosities. we find that in low-luminosity early-type galaxies the hi is almost always in a disk-like structure, with central surface densities high enough for star formation to occur. in a few luminous early-type galaxies the hi is also in a disk or in a ring-like structure, but in most luminous early-type galaxies the hi has a relatively irregular morphology. the surface densities in the hi disks in luminous early-type galaxies are lower than in the hi disks in low-luminosity early-type galaxies and no large-scale star formation should occur in these disks. we discuss these different hi characteristics in the context of other properties of early-type galaxies that correlate with luminosity. \\n  using data from the alfalfa arecibo hi survey of galaxies and the virgo cluster x-ray pressure profiles from xmm-newton, we investigate the possibility that starless dark hi clumps, also known as \"dark galaxies\", are supported by external pressure in the surrounding intercluster medium. we find that the starless hi clump masses, velocity dispersions and positions allow these clumps to be in pressure equilibrium with the x-ray gas near the virial radius of the virgo cluster. we predict the sizes of these clumps to range from 1-10 kpc, in agreement with the range of sizes found for spatially resolved hi starless clumps outside of virgo. based on the predicted hi surface density of the virgo sources, as well as a sample of other similar resolved alfalfa hi dark clumps with follow up opticalradio observations, we predict that most of the hi dark clumps are on the cusp of forming stars. these hi sources therefore mark the transition between starless hi clouds and dwarf galaxies with stars. \\n  the process of atomic-to-molecular (hi-to-h_2) gas conversion is fundamental for molecular-cloud formation and star formation. 21 cm observations of the star-forming region w43 revealed extremely high hi column densities, of 120-180 m_{\\\\odot} pc^{-2}, a factor of 10-20 larger than predicted by hi-to-h_2 transition theories. we analyze the observed hi with an hi-to-h_2 transition theoretical model, and show that the theory-observation discrepancy cannot be explained by the intense radiation in w43, nor by variations of the assumed volume density or h_2 formation-rate coefficient. we show that the large observed hi columns are naturally explained by several (9-22) hi-to-h_2 transition layers, superimposed along the sightlines of w43. we discuss other possible interpretations such as a non-steady-state scenario, and inefficient dust absorption. the case of w43 suggests that hi thresholds reported in extra-galactic observations are probably not associated with a single hi-to-h_2 transition, but are rather a result of several transition layers (clouds) along the sightlines, beam-diluted with diffuse inter-cloud gas. \\n  we present a study of the expected properties of the low redshift damped lyman-alpha absorber population determined from a sample of hi-selected galaxies in the local universe. because of a tight correlation between the hi mass and hi cross-section, which we demonstrate spans all galaxy types, we can use our hi-selected sample to predict the properties of the absorption line systems. we use measurements of the number density and hi cross-section of galaxies to show that the total hi cross-section at column densities sufficient to produce damped lyman-alpha absorption is consistent with no evolution of the absorber population. we also find that the dndz distribution is dominated by galaxies with hi masses near 10^9 msolar. however, because of the large dispersion in the correlation between hi mass and stellar luminosity, we find that the distribution of dndz as a function of l_j is fairly flat. additionally, we examine the line widths of the hi-selected galaxies and show that there may be evolution in the kinematics of hi-rich galaxies, but it is not necessary for the higher redshift population to contain a greater proportion of high mass galaxies than we find locally. \\n  we have carried out a sensitive high-latitude (|b| &gt; 15deg.) hi 21cm-line absorption survey towards 102 sources using the gmrt. with a 3-sigma detection limit in optical depth of ~0.01, this is the most sensitive hi absorption survey. we detected 126 absorption features most of which also have corresponding hi emission features in the leiden dwingeloo survey of galactic neutral hydrogen. the histogram of random velocities of the absorption features is well-fit by two gaussians centered at v(lsr) ~ 0 kms with velocity dispersions of 7.6 +- 0.3 kms and 21 +- 4 kms respectively. about 20% of the hi absorption features form the larger velocity dispersion component. the hi absorption features forming the narrow gaussian have a mean optical depth of 0.20 +- 0.19, a mean hi column density of (1.46 +- 1.03) x 10^{20} cm^{-2}, and a mean spin temperature of 121 +- 69 k. these hi concentrations can be identified with the standard hi clouds in the cold neutral medium of the galaxy. the hi absorption features forming the wider gaussian have a mean optical depth of 0.04 +- 0.02, a mean hi column density of (4.3 +- 3.4) x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, and a mean spin temperature of 125 +- 82 k. the hi column densities of these fast clouds decrease with their increasing random velocities. these fast clouds can be identified with a population of clouds detected so far only in optical absorption and in hi emission lines with a similar velocity dispersion. this population of fast clouds is likely to be in the lower galactic halo. \\n  we present results from gmrt hi 21 cm line observations of the interacting galaxy pair arp 181 (ngc 3212 and ngc 3215) at z =0.032. we find almost all of the detected hi (90%) displaced well beyond the optical disks of the pair with the highest density hi located ~70 kpc west of the pair. an hi bridge extending between the optical pair and the bulk of the hi together with their hi deficiencies provide strong evidence that the interaction between the pair has removed most of their hi to the current projected position. hi to the west of the pair has two approximately equal intensity peaks. the hi intensity maximum furthest to the west coincides with a small spiral companion sdss j102726.32+794911.9 which shows enhanced mid-infrared (spitzer), uv (galex) and h alpha emission indicating intense star forming activity. the hi intensity maximum close to the arp 181 pair, coincides with a diffuse optical cloud detected in uv (galex) at the end of the stellar and hi tidal tails originating at ngc 3212 and, previously proposed to be a tidal dwarf galaxy in formation. future sensitive hi surveys by telescopes like askap should prove to be powerful tools for identifying tidal dwarfs at moderate to large redshifts to explore in detail the evolution of dwarf galaxies in the universe. \\n  we present interferometric observations of hi in nine slow rotator early-type galaxies of the atlas3d sample. with these data, we now have sensitive hi searches in 34 of the 36 slow rotators. the aggregate detection rate is 32\\\\% \\\\pm 8\\\\%, consistent with previous work; however, we find two detections with extremely high hi masses, whose gas kinematics are substantially different from what was previously known about hi in slow rotators. these two cases (ngc 1222 and ngc 4191) broaden the known diversity of hi properties in slow rotators. ngc 1222 is a merger remnant with prolate-like rotation and, if it is indeed prolate in shape, an equatorial gas disc; ngc 4191 has two counterrotating stellar discs and an unusually large hi disc. we comment on the implications of this disc for the formation of 2\\\\sigma galaxies. in general, the hi detection rate, the incidence of relaxed hi discs, and the histellar mass ratios of slow rotators are indistinguishable from those of fast rotators. these broad similarities suggest that the hi we are detecting now is unrelated to the galaxies\\' formation processes and was often acquired after their stars were mostly in place. we also discuss the hi nondetections; some of these galaxies that are undetected in hi or co are detected in other tracers (e.g. fir fine structure lines and dust). the question of whether there is cold gas in massive galaxies\\' scoured nuclear cores still needs work. finally, we discuss an unusual isolated hi cloud with a surprisingly faint (undetected) optical counterpart. \\n  we present a method to determine the spin temperature t_{\\\\rm s} and volume density n of hi gas simultaneously along the tangent-point circle of galactic rotation in the milky way by using the least-\\\\chi^2 method. the best-fit t_{\\\\rm s} is shown to range either in t_{\\\\rm s}=100-120 k or in 1000-3000 k, indicating that the gas is either in cold hi phase with high density and large optical depth, or in warm hi with low density and small optical depth. averaged values at 3\\\\le r \\\\le 8 kpc are obtained to be t_{\\\\rm s}=106.7 \\\\pm 16.0 k and n=1.53\\\\pm 0.86 h cm^{-3} for cold hi, and 1720 \\\\pm 1060 k and 0.38 \\\\pm 0.10 h cm^{-3} for warm hi, where r=8\\\\ |\\\\sin \\\\ l| kpc is the galacto-centric distance along the tangent-point circle. the cold hi appears in spiral arms and rings, whereas warm hi in the inter-arm regions. the cold hi is denser by a factor of \\\\sim 4 than warm hi. the present analysis has revealed the hidden hi mass in cold and optically thick phase in the galactic disk. the total hi mass inside the solar circle is shown to be greater by a factor of 2 - 2.5 than the current estimation by optically thin assumption. \\n  we investigate the neutral hydrogen (hi) content of sixteen groups for which we have multi-wavelength data including x-ray observations. wide-field imaging of the groups was obtained with the 20-cm multibeam system on the 64-m parkes telescope. we have detected ten previously uncatalogued hi sources, one of which has no visible optical counterpart. we examine the hi properties of the groups, compared to their x-ray characteristics, finding that those groups with a higher x-ray temperature and luminosity contain less hi per galaxy. the hi content of a group depends on its morphological make-up, with those groups dominated by early-type galaxies containing the least total hi. we determined the expected hi for the spiral galaxies in the groups, and found that a number of the galaxies were hi deficient. the hi deficient spirals were found both in groups with and without a hot intra-group medium. the hi deficient galaxies were not necessarily found at the centre of the groups, however, we did find that two thirds of hi deficient galaxies were found within about 1 mpc from the group centre, indicating that the group environment is affecting the gas-loss from these galaxies. we determined the hi mass function for a composite sample of 15 groups, and found that it is significantly flatter than the field hi mass function. we also find a lack of high hi-mass galaxies in groups. one possible cause of this effect is the tidal stripping of hi gas from spiral galaxies as they are pre-processed in groups. \\n  we analyze the radial distribution of hi gas for 23 disk galaxies with unusually high hi content from the bluedisk sample, along with a similar-sized sample of \"normal\" galaxies. we propose an empirical model to fit the radial profile of the hi surface density, an exponential function with a depression near the center. the radial hi surface density profiles are very homogeneous in the outer regions of the galaxy; the exponentially declining part of the profile has a scale-length of \\\\sim 0.18 r1, where r1 is the radius where the column density of the hi is 1 m_{\\\\odot} pc^{-2}. this holds for all galaxies, independent of their stellar or hi mass. the homogenous outer profiles, combined with the limited range in hi surface density in the non-exponential inner disk, results in the well-known tight relation between hi size and hi mass. by comparing the radial profiles of the hi-rich galaxies with those of the control systems, we deduce that in about half the galaxies, most of the excess gas lies outside the stellar disk, in the exponentially declining outer regions of the hi disk. in the other half, the excess is more centrally peaked. we compare our results with existing smoothed-particle hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models of disk galaxy formation in a \\\\lambda cold dark matter universe. both the hydro simulations and the semi-analytic models reproduce the hi surface density profiles and the hi size-mass relation without further tuning of the simulation and model inputs. in the semi-analytic models, the universal shape of the outer hi radial profiles is a consequence of the {\\\\em assumption} that infalling gas is always distributed exponentially. the conversion of atomic gas to molecular form explains the limited range of hi surface densities in the inner disk. these two factors produce the tight hi mass-size relation. \\n  we present new high-resolution hi spectral line imaging of coma p, the brightest hi source in the system hi 1232+20. this extremely low surface brightness galaxy was first identified in the alfalfa survey as an \"(almost) dark\" object: a clearly extragalactic hi source with no obvious optical counterpart in existing optical survey data (although faint ultraviolet emission was detected in archival galex imaging). using a combination of data from the westerbork synthesis radio telescope and the karl g. jansky very large array, we investigate the hi morphology and kinematics at a variety of physical scales. the hi morphology is irregular, reaching only moderate maxima in mass surface density (peak \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm hi}\\\\sim 10 m_{\\\\odot} pc^{-2}). gas of lower surface brightness extends to large radial distances, with the hi diameter measured at 4.0\\\\pm0.2 kpc inside the 1 m_{\\\\odot} pc^{-2} level. we quantify the relationships between hi gas mass surface density and various types of star formation by considering galex far ultraviolet observations and h\\\\alpha nondetections. we describe coma p\\'s complex hi kinematics using spatially resolved position-velocity analysis and three-dimensional modeling. both methods of analysis suggest that coma p\\'s kinematics show signatures of either the collision of two hi disks or a significant infall event. coma p is just consistent (within 3\\\\sigma) with the known m_{\\\\rm hi} -- d_{\\\\rm hi} scaling relation. it is either too large for its hi mass, has too low an hi mass for its hi size, or the two hi components artificially extend its hi size. coma p lies within the empirical scatter at the faint end of the baryonic tully--fisher relation, although the complexity of the hi dynamics complicates the interpretation. the collective hi characteristics of coma p make it unusual among known galaxies in the nearby universe. [abridged] \\n  high-sensitivity maps of the large-scale structure of atomic hydrogen in the starburst dwarf galaxy ngc 1569 show evidence for an hi cloud with a mass of 7*10**6 m_sun, at a projected distance of 5 kpc from the parent galaxy. this cloud may be a condensation in a low-column-density hi halo or a companion galaxyhi-cloud. ngc 1569 and its companion are connected by a low surface brightness hi bridge. at the edge of ngc1569, the hi bridge coincides with h_alpha arcs, also detected in soft x-rays. \\n  we discuss the properties of the hi in low-luminosity early-type galaxies. the morphology of the hi is more regular than that of the hi in many more-luminous early-type galaxies. the hi is always distributed in a disk and is more centrally concentrated. the central hi surface densities are higher than in luminous early-type galaxies and are high enough for star formation to occur. \\n  karl pearson played an enormous role in determining the content and organization of statistical research in his day, through his research, his teaching, his establishment of laboratories, and his initiation of a vast publishing program. his technical contributions had initially and continue today to have a profound impact upon the work of both applied and theoretical statisticians, partly through their inadequately acknowledged influence upon ronald a. fisher. particular attention is drawn to two of pearson\\'s major errors that nonetheless have left a positive and lasting impression upon the statistical world. \\n  in a recent comment [arxiv: 1101.3980] shalaby criticised our paper \"families of particles with different masses in pt-symmetric quantum field theory\" [arxiv:1002.3253]. on examining his arguments, we find that there are serious flaws at almost every stage of his comment. in view of space and time considerations, we point out the major flaws that render his arguments invalid. essentially shalaby is attempting to obtain our results from a variational principle and to find a physical interpretation of his calculation. the variational procedure that he uses is inapplicable, and his description of the physics is wrong. we thus refute his criticism on all levels. \\n  g.v.juggarow was one of the early pioneers of observational astronomy in india who built his own observatory in 1840 at vizagapatnam. his legacy was continued by his son-in-law a.v.nursing row till 1892, his daughter till 1894, madras government till 1898, and his grandson till it became inactive in early 1900s. observations of comets, planetary transits, stellar occultations etc have been continued along with meteorological observations. celestial photography was also started at the observatory. after 1898 the observatory\\'s activities were re-oriented towards meteorology. the establishment of the observatory, the personalities involved and the final closing of the institution are described here. \\n  neutral hydrogen (hi) 21 cm absorption has been detected against more and more powerful radio jets. in this work, based on the guppta et al. 2006a sample, we present our preliminary study of the correlations between the hi column density n(hi) and the jet power, n(hi) versus the low frequency luminosity at 408mhz, and n(hi) versus the radio luminosity at 1400mhz. \\n  formation of gmcs is one of the most crucial issues in galaxy evolution. i will compare co and hi in the lmc in 3 dimensional space for the first time aiming at revealing the physical connection between gmcs and associated hi gas at a ~40 pc scale. the present major findings are 1) [total co intensity] [total hi intensity]0.8 for the 110 gmcs, and 2) the hi intensity tends to increase with the evolution of gmcs. i argue that these findings are consistent with the growth of gmcs via hi accretion over a time scale of a few x 10 myrs. i will also discuss the role of the background stellar gravity and the dynamical compression by supershells in formation of gmcs. \\n  neutral hydrogen observations with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope are presented for a sample of 73 late-type dwarf galaxies. these observations are part of the whisp project (westerbork hi survey of spiral and irregular galaxies). here we present hi maps, velocity fields, global profiles and radial surface density profiles of hi, as well as hi masses, hi radii and line widths. for the late-type galaxies in our sample, we find that the ratio of hi extent to optical diameter, defined as 6.4 disk scale lengths, is on average 1.8+-0.8, similar to that seen in spiral galaxies. most of the dwarf galaxies in this sample are rich in hi, with a typical m_hil_b of 1.5. the relative hi content m_hil_r increases towards fainter absolute magnitudes and towards fainter surface brightnesses. dwarf galaxies with lower average hi column densities also have lower average optical surface brightnesses. we find that lopsidedness is as common among dwarf galaxies as it is in spiral galaxies. about half of the dwarf galaxies in our sample have asymmetric global profiles, a third has a lopsided hi distribution, and about half shows signs of kinematic lopsidedness. \\n  atca hi and radio continuum observations of the peculiar southern galaxy ic2554 and its surroundings reveal typical signatures of an interacting galaxy group. we detected a large hi cloud between ic2554 and the elliptical galaxy ngc3136b. the gas dynamics in ic2554 itself, which is sometimes described as a colliding pair, are surprisingly regular, whereas ngc3136b was not detected. the hi cloud, which emerges from ic2554 as a large arc-shaped plume, has a size of about 30 kpc, larger than that of ic2554. the total hi mass of the ic2554 system is about 2 x 10^9 msun, a third of which resides in the hi cloud. it is possible that tidal interaction between ic2554 and ngc3136b caused this spectacular hi cloud, but the possibility of ic2554 being a merger remnant is also discussed. we also detected hi gas in the nearby galaxies eso092-g009 and rkk1959 as well as an associated hi cloud, atca j1006-6710. together they have an hi mass of about 4.6 x 10^8 msun. another new hi source, atca j1007-6659, with an hi mass of only about 2.2 x 10^7 msun was detected roughly between ic2554 and eso092-g009 and corresponds to a face-on low surface brightness dwarf galaxy. star formation is evident only in the galaxy ic2554 with a rate of about 4 msunyr. \\n  the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey is a program aimed at obtaining a census of hi-bearing objects over a cosmologically significant volume of the local universe. when complete in ~3-4 years, it will cover 7000 square degrees of high latitude sky using the 305m telescope and the seven-beam arecibo l-band feed array (alfa). as of may 1, 2008, almost 60% of the required observations are complete and a catalog exists in preliminary form for 25% of the final sky area. alfalfa is detecting about twice as many hi sources as predicted based on previously published hi mass functions and should deliver a final catalog of &gt;25000 extragalactic hi sources. alfalfa will detect hundreds of galaxies with hi masses less than 10**7.5 solar masses and similarly large numbers greater than 10**10.3 msun. its centroiding accuracy allows for the immediate identification of highly probably optical counterparts to each hi detection. fewer than 3% of all extragalactic hi sources, and &lt; 1% of ones with hi masses &gt; 10**9.5 msun cannot be identified with a stellar counterpart. the hundreds of hi sources with observed line widths of 20-30 kms include a population of optically faint dwarf galaxies. the objects with highest hi masses exhibit a range of morphologies, optical colors and surface brightnesses, but most appear to be massive disk systems. the latter represent the population likely to dominate future studies of hi at high redshift. \\n  we compare sensitive hi data from the hi nearby galaxy survey (things) and deep far uv (fuv) data from galex in the outer disk of m83. the fuv and hi maps show a stunning spatial correlation out to almost 4 optical radii (r25), roughly the extent of our maps. this underscores that hi traces the gas reservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at least low level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere hi is observed. whereas the average fuv intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before leveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in hi surface density is more subtle. low hi columns (&lt;2 m_solarpc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk, which is not the case within r25. the time for star formation to consume the available hi, inferred from the ratio of hi to fuv intensity, rises with increasing radius before leveling off at ~100 gyr, i.e., many hubble times, near ~1.7 r25. assuming the relatively short h2 depletion times observed in the inner parts of galaxies hold in outer disks, the conversion of hi into bound, molecular clouds seems to limit star formation in outer galaxy disks. the long consumption times suggest that most of the extended hi observed in m83 will not be consumed by in situ star formation. however, even these low star formation rates are enough to expect moderate chemical enrichment in a closed outer disk. \\n  we present ultraviolet (uv) follow-up of a sample of potential dwarf galaxy candidates selected for their neutral hydrogen (hi) properties, taking advantage of the low uv background seen by the galex satellite and its large and publicly available imaging footprint. the hi clouds, which are drawn from published galfa-hi and alfalfa hi survey compact cloud catalogs, are selected to be galaxy candidates based on their spatial compactness and non-association with known high-velocity cloud complexes or galactic hi emission. based on a comparison of their uv characteristics to those of known dwarf galaxies, half (48%) of the compact hi clouds have at least one potential stellar counterpart with uv properties similar to those of nearby dwarf galaxies. if galaxies, the star formation rates, hi masses, and star formation efficiencies of these systems follow the trends seen for much larger galaxies. the presence of uv emission is an efficient method to identify the best targets for spectroscopic follow-up, which is necessary to prove that the stars are associated with the compact hi. further, searches of this nature help to refine the salient hi properties of likely dwarfs (even beyond the local group). in particular, hi compact clouds considered to be velocity outliers relative to their neighbor hi clouds have the most significant detection rate of single, appropriate uv counterparts. correcting for the sky coverage of the two all-arecibo sky surveys yielding the compact hi clouds, these results may imply the presence of potentially hundreds of new tiny galaxies across the entire sky. \\n  our work is based on the \"bluedisk\" project, a program to map the neutral gas in a sample of 25 hi-rich spirals and a similar number of control galaxies with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt). in this paper we focus on the hi properties of the galaxies in the environment of our targeted galaxies. in total, we extract 65 galaxies from the wsrt cubes with stellar masses between 10^8m_{\\\\odot} and 10^{11}m_{\\\\odot}. most of these galaxies are located on the same hi mass-size relation and \"hi-plane\" as normal spiral galaxies. we find that companions around hi-rich galaxies tend to be hi-rich as well and to have larger r90,hir50,hi. this suggests a scenario of \"hi conformity\", similar to the colour conformity found by weinmann et al. (2006): galaxies tend to adopt the hi properties of their neighbours. we visually inspect the outliers from the hi mass-size relation and galaxies which are offset from the hi plane and find that they show morphological and kinematical signatures of recent interactions with their environment. we speculate that these outliers have been disturbed by tidal or ram-pressure stripping processes, or in a few cases, by accretion events. \\n  in this work, we study the basic statistical properties of hi-selected galaxies extracted from six different semi-analytic models, all run on the same cosmological n-body simulation. one model includes an explicit treatment for the partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular hydrogen. all models considered agree nicely with the measured hi mass function in the local universe, with the measured scaling relations between hi and galaxy stellar mass, and with the predicted 2-point correlation function for hi rich galaxies. one exception is given by one model that predicts very little hi associated with galaxies in haloes above 10^12 msun: we argue this is due to a too efficient radio-mode feedback for central galaxies, and to a combination of efficient stellar feedback and instantaneous stripping of hot gas for satellites. we demonstrate that treatment of satellite galaxies introduces large uncertainties at low hi masses. while models assuming non instantaneous stripping of hot gas tend to form satellite galaxies with hi masses slightly smaller than those of centrals with the same stellar mass, instantaneous gas stripping does not translate necessarily in lower hi masses. in fact, the adopted stellar feedback and star formation affect the satellites too. we analyze the relation between hi content and spin of simulated haloes: low spin haloes tend to host hi poor galaxies while high spin haloes are populated by galaxies in a wide range of hi mass. in our simulations, this is due to a correlation between the initial gas disk size and the halo spin. \\n  we present a sample of 115 very low optical surface brightness, highly extended, hi-rich galaxies carefully selected from the alfalfa survey that have similar optical absolute magnitudes, surface brightnesses, and radii to recently discovered \"ultra-diffuse\" galaxies (udgs). however, these systems are bluer and have more irregular morphologies than other udgs, are isolated, and contain significant reservoirs of hi. we find that while these sources have normal star formation rates for hi selected galaxies of similar stellar mass, they have very low star formation efficiencies. we further present deep optical and hi synthesis follow up imaging of three of these hi-bearing ultra-diffuse sources. we measure hi diameters extending to ~40 kpc, but note that while all three sources have large hi diameters for their stellar mass, they are consistent with the hi mass - hi radius relation. we further analyze the hi velocity widths and rotation velocities for the unresolved and resolved sources respectively, and find that the sources appear to inhabit halos of dwarf galaxies. we estimate spin parameters, and suggest that these sources may exist in high spin parameter halos, and as such may be potential hi-rich progenitors to the ultra-diffuse galaxies observed in cluster environments. \\n  hi intensity mapping data traces the large-scale structure matter distribution using the integrated emission of neutral hydrogen gas (hi). the cross-correlation of the intensity maps with optical galaxy surveys can mitigate foreground and systematic effects, but has been shown to significantly depend on galaxy evolution parameters of the hi and the optical sample. previously, we have shown that the shot noise of the cross-correlation scales with the hi content of the optical samples, such that the shot noise estimation infers the average hi masses of these samples. in this article, we present an adaptive framework for the cross-correlation of hi intensity maps with galaxy samples using our implementation of the halo model formalism (murray et al 2018, in prep) which utilises the halo occupation distribution of galaxies to predict their power spectra. we compare two hi population models, tracing the spatial halo and the galaxy distribution respectively, and present their auto- and cross-power spectra with an associated galaxy sample. we find that the choice of the hi model and the distribution of the hi within the galaxy sample have minor significance for the shape of the auto- and cross-correlations, but highly impact the measured shot noise amplitude of the estimators, a finding we confirm with simulations. we demonstrate parameter estimation of the hi halo occupation models and advocate this framework for the interpretation of future experimental data, with the prospect of determining the hi masses of optical galaxy samples via the cross-correlation shot noise. \\n  we present giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) hi 21cm emission images of the z=0.009 damped lyman-alpha (dla) absorber towards the qso hs 1543+5921. the dla has been earlier identified as a low surface brightness galaxy sbs 1543+593 at an impact parameter of ~ 400 pc to the qso line of sight. the extremely low redshift of the absorber allows us to make spatially resolved images of the 21cm emission; besides the hi mass, this also enables us to determine the velocity field of the galaxy and, hence, to estimate its dynamical mass.   we obtain a total hi mass of ~ 1.4x10^9 msun, considerably smaller than the value of m*(hi) determined from blind 21cm emission surveys. this continues the trend of low hi mass in all low redshift dlas for which hi emission observations have been attempted. we also find that the qso lies behind a region of low local hi column density in the foreground galaxy. this is interesting in view of suggestions that dla samples are biased against high hi column density systems. the dynamical mass of the galaxy is found to be mdyn ~ 5x10^9 msun. \\n  we report on neutral hydrogen observations of a ~ 5.5 x 5.5 degree field around the ngc 1566 galaxy group with the multibeam narrow-band system on the 64-m parkes telescope. we detected thirteen hi sources in the field, including two galaxies not previously known to be members of the group, bringing the total number of confirmed galaxies in this group to 26. each of the hi galaxies can be associated with an optically catalogued galaxy. no \\'intergalactic hi clouds\\' were found to an hi mass limit of ~ 3.5 x 10^8 msun. we have estimated the expected hi content of the late-type galaxies in this group and find the total detected hi is consistent with our expectations. however, while no global hi deficiency is inferred for this group, two galaxies exhibit individual hi deficiencies. further observations are needed to determine the gas removal mechanisms in these galaxies. \\n  a banach space x is said to be q.h.i. if eve\\\\-ry infinite dimensional quo\\\\-tient spa\\\\-ce of x is h.i.: that is, a space is q.h.i. if the h.i. property is not only stable passing to subspaces, but also passing to quotients and to the dual. we show that gowers-maurey\\'s space is q.h.i.; then we provide an example of a reflexive h.i. space {\\\\cal x} whose dual is not h.i., from which it follows that \\\\cal x is not q.h.i. \\n  in his interviews with eckermann in the 1820s, goethe referred to his theory of colors as his greatest and ultimate achievement. its reception following publication in 1810 and subsequent reviews throughout the history of physical science did not reflect this self-assessment. even hermann von helmholtz, who in part modeled his scientific work after goethe\\'s, initially thought that goethe\\'s poetic genius prevented him from understanding physical science. why did goethe champion his farbenlehre so ardently even years after it was dismissed by almost everyone else? in answering this question, this essay will attempt to add to the existing scholarship by considering goethe\\'s theory of colors in the context of his natural philosophy, and generalizing the variety of objectifications of the concepts invoked by his color theory and their relationships to goethe\\'s epistemology and newton\\'s mechanics. in this fashion, i attempt to show that the reason for goethe\\'s self-assessment of his theory of colors is less enigmatic than appears from its examination solely as a work of physics. rather, zur farbenlehre was the clearest expression of goethe\\'s most universal archetype-- polarity of opposites-- which bridged goethe\\'s conflicts with kant\\'s and spinoza\\'s epistemologies, and in an over-reaching way served as a cosmology underlying goethe\\'s art and his science. \\n  e. m. chudnovsky has recently posted on the arxive his reply (arxiv:0805.2918) to my comment (phys. rev. lett. 100, 199703 (2008)) on his recent letter (e. m. chudnovsky, phys. rev. lett. 99, 206601 (2007)). in order to avoid possible misunderstandings in the evaluation of his letter, i am posting my comment with some remarks on the contents of his reply. \\n  we present the first results of a targeted survey carried out with the 305 m arecibo telescope to detect hi-line emission from galaxies at redshift z&gt;0.16. the targets, selected from the sloan digital sky survey database, are non-interacting disk galaxies in relatively isolated fields. we present here the hi spectra and derived hi parameters for ten objects detected in this pilot program. all are massive disk galaxies in the redshift interval 0.17-0.25 (i.e. 2-3 gyr look-back time), with hi masses m_hi=3-8 x 10^10 msun and high gas mass fractions (hi - to - stellar mass ratios ~10-30%). our results demonstrate the efficacy of exploiting arecibo\\'s large collecting area to measure the hi mass and rotational velocity of galaxies above redshift z=0.2. in particular, this sample includes the highest redshift detections of hi emission from individual galaxies made to date. extension of this pilot program will allow us to study the hi properties of field galaxies at cosmological distances, thus complementing ongoing radio synthesis observations of cluster samples at z~0.2. \\n  in this paper the model for the p-p accretion process in hi reactions is described. the mediation by x boson (mx ~ 1014 gev) is outlined. the heaviside equation for the thermal processes in hi scattering is obtained and solved. the possibility of the detection of the collective excitation in hi generated by rhic and lhc \\n  the spatial clustering properties of hi galaxies can be studied using the formalism of the halo occupation distribution (hod). the resulting parameter constraints describe properties like gas richness verses environment. unfortunately, clustering studies based on individual hi galaxies will be restricted to the local universe for the foreseeable future, even with the deepest hi surveys. here we discuss how clustering studies of the hi hod could be extended to moderate redshift, through observations of fluctuations in the combined 21cm intensity of unresolved galaxies. in particular we make an analytic estimate for the clustering of hi in the hod. our joint goals are to estimate i) the amplitude of the signal, and ii) the sensitivity of telescopes like the australian ska pathfinder to hod parameters. we find that the power spectrum of redshifted 21cm intensity could be used to study the distribution of hi within dark matter halos at z&gt;0.5 where individual galaxies cannot be detected. in addition to the hod of hi, the amplitude of the 21cm power spectrum would also yield estimates of the cosmic hi content at epochs between the local universe, and redshifts probed by damped ly-alpha absorbers. \\n  in this paper i shall try to sketch some typical aspects of erich lehmann\\'s contributions to statistics through his research, his teaching, his service to the profession and his personality. \\n  we present new hi observations of hoag\\'s object obtained with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt). the data show that the luminous optical ring around the elliptical body has a bright hi counterpart that shares the kinematical properties of the optical ring. the entire hi structure is twice as large as the optical ring and shows a mild warp in its outer regions relative to the inner ring. we detect two additional hi sources close in redshift to that of hoag\\'s object, and report on a newly identified sdss optical companion galaxy. the hi sources are ~0.3 and ~1 mpc away in projected distance, and the companion galaxy is also ~1 mpc away. our main conclusion is that the hi detected in hoag\\'s object shows no indication that this galaxy has experienced a recent (less than ~1 gyr ago) accretion event. at least one of the two additional hi detected objects does not have an optical counterpart. one possibility is that this object is an hi filament left over from an interaction shaping hoag\\'s object, in which case this interaction must also have occurred at least 1-2 gyr ago. \\n  observations of ongoing hi accretion in nearby galaxies have only identified about 10% of the needed fuel to sustain star formation in these galaxies. most of these observations have been conducted using interferometers and may have missed lower column density, diffuse, hi gas that may trace the missing 90% of gas. such gas may represent the so-called \"cold flows\" predicted by current theories of galaxy formation to have never been heated above the virial temperature of the dark matter halo. as a first attempt to identify such cold flows around nearby galaxies and complete the census of hi down to n(hi)~10^18 cm^-2, i used the robert c. byrd green bank telescope (gbt) to map the circumgalactic (r &lt; 100-200 kpc) hi environment around ngc 2997 and ngc 6946. the resulting gbt observations cover a four square degree area around each galaxy with a 5-sigma detection limit of n(hi)~10^18 cm^-2 over a 20 kms linewidth. this project complements absorption line studies, which are well-suited to the regime of lower n(hi). around ngc 2997, the gbt hi data reveal an extended hi disk and all of its surrounding gas-rich satellite galaxies, but no filamentary features. furthermore, the hi mass as measured with the gbt is only 7% higher than past interferometric measurements. after correcting for resolution differences, the hi extent of the galaxy is 23% larger at the n(hi)~1.2x10^18 cm^-2 level as measured by the gbt. on the other hand, the hi observations of ngc 6946 reveal a filamentary feature apparently connecting ngc 6946 with its nearest companions. this hi filament has n(hi)~10^18 cm^-2 and a fwhm of 55+-5 kms and was invisible in past interferometer observations. the properties of this filament are broadly consistent with being a cold flow or debris from a past tidal interaction between ngc 6946 and its satellites. \\n  as a quenching mechanism, agn feedback could suppress on-going star formation in their host galaxies. on the basis of a sample of galaxies selected from alfalfa hi survey, the dependence of their hi mass m[hi], stellar mass m[*] &amp; hi-to-stellar mass ratio m[hi]m[*] on various tracers of agn activity are presented and analyzed in this paper. almost all the agn-hostings in this sample are gas-rich galaxies, and there is no any evidence to be shown to indicate that the agn activity could increasedecrease either m[hi] or m[hi]m[*]. the cold neutral gas can not be fixed positions accurately just based on available hi data due to the large beam size of alfalfa survey. in addition, even though agn-hostings are more easily detected by hi survey compared with absorption line galaxies, these two types of galaxies show similar star formation history. if an agn-hosting would ultimately evolve into an old red galaxy with few cold gas, then when and how the gas has been exhausted have to be solved by future hypotheses and observations. \\n  we review the results of hi line surveys of extragalactic sources in the local universe. in the last two decades major efforts have been made in establishing on firm statistical grounds the properties of the hi source population, the two most prominent being the hi parkes all sky survey (hipass) and the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey (alfalfa). we review the choices of technical parameters in the design and optimization of spectro-photometric \"blind\" hi surveys, which for the first time produced extensive hi-selected data sets. particular attention is given to the relationship between optical and hi populations, the differences in their clustering properties and the importance of hi-selected samples in contributing to the understanding of apparent conflicts between observation and theory on the abundance of low mass halos. the last section of this paper provides an overview of currently ongoing and planned surveys which will explore the cosmic evolution of properties of the hi population. \\n  we present a new strategy for fitting the structure and kinematics of the hi in edge-on galaxies using a fit to the terminal-velocity channel maps of a hi data cube. the strategy can deal with self-absorbing hi gas and the presence of warps. the method is first tested on a series of models. we demonstrate that fitting optically thin models to real galaxies will lead to an overestimation of the thickness and velocity dispersion, and to a serious underestimation of the hi face-on column densities. we subsequently fit both self-absorption and optically thin models to the hi data of six edge-on galaxies. in three of these we have also measured the velocity dispersion. on average 27 \\\\pm 6 % of the total hi mass of edge-on galaxies is hidden by self-absorption. this implies that the hi mass, thickness and velocity dispersion of galaxies is typically underestimated in the literature. \\n  the prominent russian mathematician igor rostislavovich shafarevich passed away on february 19, 2017. in this article we supply his biography, discuss his many important contributions to number theory, algebra and algebraic geometry, and also discuss his political activity and some of his numerous publications on social issues. \\n  this article explores the ideas that went into george boole\\'s development of an algebra for logical inference in his book the laws of thought. we explore in particular his wife mary boole\\'s claim that he was deeply influenced by indian logic and argue that his work was more than a framework for processing propositions. by exploring parallels between his work and indian logic, we are able to explain several peculiarities of this work. \\n  [abridged] we study the abundance and clustering properties of hi at redshifts z\\\\leqslant5 using tng100, a large state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of a 75 mpch box size. we show that most of the hi lies within dark matter halos and quantify the average hi mass hosted by halos of mass m at redshift z. we find that only halos with circular velocities larger than \\\\simeq 30 kms contain hi. while the density profiles of hi exhibit a large halo-to-halo scatter, the mean profiles are universal across mass and redshift. the hi in low-mass halos is mostly located in the central galaxy, while in massive halos is concentrated in the satellites. we show that the hi and matter density probability distribution functions differ significantly. our results point out that for small halos the hi bulk velocity goes in the same direction and has the same magnitude as the halo peculiar velocity, while in large halos differences show up. we find that halo hi velocity dispersion follows a power-law with halo mass. we find a complicated hi bias, with hi becoming non-linear already at k=0.3 hmpc at z\\\\gtrsim3. our simulation reproduces the dlas bias value from observations. we find that the clustering of hi can be accurately reproduced by perturbative methods. we identify a new secondary bias, by showing that the clustering of halos depends not only on mass but also on hi content. we compute the amplitude of the hi shot-noise and find that it is small at all redshifts. we study the clustering of hi in redshift-space, and show that linear theory can explain the ratio between the monopoles in redshift- and real-space down to small scales at high redshift. we find that the amplitude of the fingers-of-god effect is larger for hi than for matter. we point out that accurate 21 cm maps can be created from n-body or approximate simulations rather than full hydrodynamic simulations. \\n  we explore the quantified morphology of atomic hydrogen (hi) disks in the virgo cluster. these galaxies display a wealth of phenomena in their hi morphology, e.g., tails, truncation and warps. these morphological disturbances are related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies undergo in this dense cluster environment. to quantify the morphological transformation of the hi disks, we compute the morphological parameters of cas, gini, and m20 and our own gm for 51 galaxies in 48 hi column density maps from the viva project. some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space of relatively low resolution hi data. truncation of the hi disk can be cleanly identified via the concentration parameter (c&lt;1) and concentration can also be used to identify hi deficient disks (1&lt;c&lt;5). tidal interaction is typically identified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to (optical) images of galaxies. we find that some selection criteria (gini-m20, asymmetry, and a modified concentration-m20) are still applicable for the coarse (~15\" fwhm) viva hi data. the phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonably well identified using the gini-m20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tails identified but with as many contaminants). ram-pressure does move hi disks into and out of most of our interaction criteria: the ram-pressure sequence identified by vollmer et al. (2009) tracks into and out of some of these criteria (asymmetry based and the gini-m20 selections, but not the concentration-m20 or the gm based ones). therefore, future searches for interaction using hi morphologies should take ram-pressure into account as a mechanism to disturb hi disks enough to make them appear as gravitationally interacting. one mechanism would be to remove all the hi deficient (c&lt;5) disks from the sample, as these have undergone more than one hi removal mechanism. \\n  we present an analysis of new and archival vla hi observations of a sample of eleven early-type galaxies rich in co, with detailed comparisons of co and hi distributions and kinematics. the early-type sample consists of both lenticular and elliptical galaxies in a variety of environments. a range of morphologies and environments were selected in order to give a broader understanding of the origins, distribution, and fate of the cold gas in early-type galaxies. six of the eleven galaxies in the sample are detected in both hi and co. the h_{2} to hi mass ratios for this sample range from 0.2-120. the hi morphologies of the sample are consistent with that of recent hi surveys of early-type galaxies which also find a mix of hi morphologies and masses, low hi peak surface densities, and a lack of hi in early-type galaxies which reside in high density environments. the hi-detected galaxies have a wide range of hi masses (1.4\\\\times10^{6} to 1.1\\\\times10^{10} m_{\\\\odot}). there does not appear to be any correlation between the hi mass and morphology (e versus s0). when hi is detected, it is centrally peaked - there are no central kpc-scale central hi depressions like those observed for early-type spiral galaxies at similar spatial resolutions and scales. a kinematic comparison between the hi and co indicates that both cold gas components share the same origin. the primary goal of this and a series of future papers is to better understand the relationship between the atomic and molecular gas in early-type galaxies, and to compare the observed relationships with those of spiral galaxies where this relationship has been studied in depth. \\n  in this data paper we present the results of an extensive 21cm-line synthesis imaging survey of 43 spiral galaxies in the nearby ursa major cluster using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope. detailed kinematic information in the form of position-velocity diagrams and rotation curves is presented in an atlas together with hi channel maps, 21cm continuum maps, global hi profiles, radial hi surface density profiles, integrated hi column density maps, and hi velocity fields. the relation between the corrected global hi linewidth and the rotational velocities vmax and vflat as derived from the rotation curves is investigated. inclination angles obtained from the optical axis ratios are compared to those derived from the inclined hi disks and the hi velocity fields. the galaxies were not selected on the basis of their hi content but solely on the basis of their cluster membership and inclination which should be suitable for a kinematic analysis. the observed galaxies provide a well-defined, volume limited and equidistant sample, useful to investigate in detail the statistical properties of the tully-fisher relation and the dark matter halos around them. \\n  australia telescope compact array hi observations reveal the existence of 5.8x10^8 m_sun of hi gas in the central 7 kpc of the edge-on spiral galaxy ngc 3175. the detected hi and co gas can explain why star formation, as traced by other emission processes, is going on in the inner part of its disk. on the other hand, the entire outer disk, beyond 3.5 kpc radius, shows no hi emission, has a very red colour and exhibits neither radio continuum nor h-alpha emission. this indicates that the outer part of ngc 3175 is quiescent, i.e. not forming stars at a measurable rate. its hi deficiency and the small extent of the hi layer, which is confined to the boundaries of the optically visible disk, make ngc 3175 a peculiar spiral galaxy. no intergalactic hi gas in the ngc 3175 group was detected in our interferometric observations. earlier parkes telescope single dish hi observations put an upper limit on the amount of diffuse gas that might have been missed by the interferometer at 2x10^8 m_sun. on dss plates no galaxy in the ngc 3175 group of galaxies (garcia 1993) is close enough to it and none exhibits disturbances that could indicate a close interaction which might have led to the stripping of large parts of its hi gas. thus, despite an extensive multi-wavelength investigation, the reason for the unusual absence of hi and star formation activity in the outer disk of ngc 3175 remains an intriguing mystery. \\n  we have analyzed the total hi contents of 72 hickson compact groups of galaxies (hcgs) and the detailed spatial distributions and kinematics of hi within a subset of 16 groups using the high angular resolution observations obtained with the vla in order to investigate a possible evolutionary scenario for these densest systems in the present day galaxy hierarchy. for the more homogeneous subsample of 48 groups, we found a mean hi deficiency of defhi = 40 (40% of the expected hi for the lbs and morphological types of the member galaxies). the individual galaxies show larger degrees of deficiency than the groups globally, defhi = 0.62 (24% of the expected hi), due in most cases to efficient gas stripping from individual galaxies into the group environment visible in the vla maps. the degree of deficiency is found to be similar to the central galaxies of virgo and coma cluster, and coma i group, in spite of the significantly different characteristics of these environments. phase transformation of the hi should explain the deficiency. the detection rate of hcgs at x-ray wavelengths is larger for hi deficient groups. in the evolutionary scenario we propose, the amount of detected hi would decrease further with evolution, by continuous tidal stripping andor heating. the h2 content also tends to be lower than expected for the galaxies in hi deficient groups, this may suggest that the hi stripping by frequent tidal interaction breaks the balance between the disruption of molecular clouds by star formation and the replenishment from the ambient hi. \\n  an extended hi cloud (virgohi 21) with an hi mass of \\\\sim10^8 m_{\\\\odot} and no apparent optical counterpart was recently discovered in the virgo cluster. in order to understand the origin of physical properties of apparently isolated hi clouds like the virgohi21, we numerically investigate physical properties of tidal hi debris that were formed by galaxy-galaxy interaction in clusters of galaxies. our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that tidal debris with total hi masses of 10^8-10^9 m_{\\\\odot} can have (1) wide hi velocity widths (&gt;200 km s^{-1}), (2) a small mass fraction of stars (\\\\sim10%), and (3) a mean b-band surface brightness of the stellar components fainter than 30 mag arcsec^{-2}. these results suggest that the virgohi21, which lies at a projected distance of \\\\sim 150 kpc from the one-armed, hi-rich spiral galaxy m99 (ngc 4254), is tidal debris. we propose that the comparison between the simulated and the observed velocity fields of hi clouds allows us to better understand their nature and origin (e.g., whether they are just tidal debris or ``dark galaxies\\'\\' that have hi gas only and are embedded by dark matter halos). we also discuss the timescales for isolated hi gas to be evaporated by thermal conduction of the hot intracluster gas. \\n  we have carried out a blind hi survey using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope to make an inventory of objects with small hi masses (between 10^6 and 10^8 msol) and to constrain the low-mass end of the hi mass function. the survey has been conducted in a part of the volume containing the nearby canes venatici groups of galaxies. the surveyed region covers an area on the sky of about 86 square degrees and a range in velocity from about -450 to about 1330 kms. we find 70 sources in the survey by applying an automated searching algorithm. two of the detections have not been catalogued previously, but they can be assigned an optical counterpart, based on visual inspection of the second generation digital sky survey images. only one of the hi detections is without an optical counterpart. this object is detected in the vicinity of ngc4822 and it has been already detected in previous hi studies. nineteen of the objects have been detected for the first time in the 21-cm emission line in this survey. the distribution of the hi properties of our detections confirms our ability to find low mass objects. 86% of the detections have profile widths less than 130 kms and can be considered dwarf galaxy candidates. the hi fluxes measured imply that this survey goes about 10 times deeper than any previous blind hi survey. the hi mass function and the optical properties of the detected sources will be discussed in future papers. \\n  the nearby blue compact dwarf, ngc 2915, has its stellar disc embedded in a large, extended (~ 22 b-band scale-lengths) hi disc. new high-resolution hi synthesis observations of ngc 2915 have been obtained with the australia telescope compact array. these observations provide evidence of extremely complex hi kinematics within the immediate vicinity of the galaxy\\'s star-forming core. we identify and quantify double-peaked hi line profiles near the centre of the galaxy and show that the hi energetics can be accounted for by the mechanical energy output of the central high-mass stellar population within time-scales of 10^6-10^7 yr. full three-dimensional models of the hi data cube are generated and compared to the observations to test various physical scenarios associated with the high-mass star-forming core of ngc 2915. purely circular hi kinematics are ruled out together with the possibility of a high-velocity-dispersion inter-stellar medium at inner radii. radial velocities of ~ 30 kms are required to describe the central-most hi kinematics of the system. our results lend themselves to the simple physical scenario in which the young stellar core of the galaxy expels the gas outwards from the centre of the disc, thereby creating a central hi under-density. these kinematics should be thought of as being linked to a central hi outflow rather than a large-scale galactic blow-out or wind. \\n  einstein at the z\\\\\"urich polytechnic: he skipped classes, did not attend all the lectures of his professors, and before going to the examinations he studied instead from the notebooks of his good friend from class, marcel grossmann. einstein the free-thinker did not respect the two major professors in the polytechnic - heinrich friedrich weber and jean pernet - who eventually turned on him. he felt that his beloved science had lost its appeal because weber\\'s lectures did not include maxwell\\'s electromagnetic theory. einstein seldom showed up to pernet\\'s practical physics course. by his fourth-rightness and his distrust of authority he had alienated his professors, especially weber, who apparently conceived a particular dislike of him. at the z\\\\\"urich polytechnic, einstein could not easily bring himself to study what did not interest him. most of his time he spent on his own studying maxwell\\'s theory and learning at first hand the works of great pioneers in science and philosophy: boltzmann, helmholtz, kirchhoff, hertz, mach. eventually, einstein finished first in his class in the intermediate exams; second after him was his note taker grossmann. do not ever try einstein\\'s recipe for studying in college, because after obtaining the diploma, when he sought university positions, he was rebuffed. finally rescue came from grossmann, and thanks to him and his father einstein obtained a post in the patent office. there are strong reasons to believe that it was einstein\\'s rare mastery of maxwell\\'s electromagnetic theory that ultimately prompted the director of the patent office to offer him a job. \\n  despite the existence of well-defined relationships between cold gas and star formation, there is evidence that some galaxies contain large amounts of hi that do not form stars efficiently. by systematically assessing the link between hi and star formation within a sample of galaxies with extremely high hi masses (log m_him_sun &gt; 10), we uncover a population of galaxies with an unexpected combination of high hi masses and low specific star formation rates that exists primarily at stellar masses greater than log m_*m_sun ~ 10.5. we obtained hi maps of 20 galaxies in this population to understand the distribution of the hi and the physical conditions in the galaxies that could be suppressing star formation in the presence of large quantities of hi. we find that all of the galaxies we observed have low hi surface densities in the range in which inefficient star formation is common. the low hi surface densities are likely the main cause of the low ssfrs, but there is also some evidence that agn or bulges contribute to the suppression of star formation. the sample\\'s agreement with the global star formation law highlights its usefulness as a tool for understanding galaxies that do not always follow expected relationships. \\n  we present a wide (8.5x6.7 degree, 1050x825 kpc), deep (sigma(n_hi)=10^(16.8-17.5) cm^-2) neutral hydrogen (hi) map of the m101 galaxy group. we identify two new hi sources in the group environment, one an extremely low surface brightness (and hitherto unknown) dwarf galaxy, and the other a starless hi cloud, possibly primordial in origin. our data show that m101\\'s extended hi envelope (huchtmeier &amp; witzel 1979) takes the form of a ~100 kpc long tidal loop or plume of hi extending to the southwest of the galaxy. the plume has an hi mass ~ 10^8 msun and a peak column density of n_hi=5x10^17 cm^-2, and while it rotates with the main body of m101, it shows kinematic peculiarities suggestive of a warp or flaring out of the rotation plane of the galaxy. we also find two new hi clouds near the plume with masses ~ 10^7 msun, similar to hi clouds seen in the m81m82 group, and likely also tidal in nature. comparing to deep optical imaging of the m101 group, neither the plume nor the clouds have any extended optical counterparts down to a limiting surface brightness of mu_b = 29.5. we also trace hi at intermediate velocities between m101 and ngc 5474, strengthening the case for a recent interaction between the two galaxies. the kinematically complex hi structure in the m101 group, coupled with the optical morphology of m101 and its companions, suggests that the group is in a dynamically active state that is likely common for galaxies in group environments. \\n  dark gas in the interstellar medium (ism) is believed to not be detectable either in co or hi radio emission, but it is detected by other means including gamma-rays, dust emission and extinction traced outside the galactic plane at |b|&gt;5 degree. in these analyses, the 21-cm hi emission is usually assumed to be completely optically thin. we have reanalyzed the hi emission from the whole sky at |b|&gt;15 degree by considering temperature stratification in the ism inferred from the planckiras analysis of the dust properties. the results indicate that the hi emission is saturated with an optical depth ranging from 0.5 to 3 for 85% of the local hi gas. this optically thick hi is characterized by spin temperature in the range 10k-60k, significantly lower than previously postulated in the literature, whereas such low temperature is consistent with emissionabsorption measurements of the cool hi toward radio continuum sources. the distribution and the column density of the hi are consistent with those of the dark gas sug- gested by gamma-rays, and it is possible that the dark gas in the galaxy is dominated by optically thick cold hi gas. this result implies that the average density of hi is 2-2.5 times higher than that derived on the optically-thin assumption in the local ism. \\n  we investigate the nature of hi-rich galaxies from the alfalfa and gass surveys, which are defined as galaxies in the top 10th percentile in atomic gas fraction at a given stellar mass. we analyze outer (r&gt;1.5 re) stellar populations for a subset of face-on systems using optical g-r versus r-z colourcolour diagrams. the results are compared with those from control samples that are defined without regard to atomic gas content, but are matched in redshift, stellar mass and structural parameters. hi-rich early-type (c&gt;2.6) and late-type (c&lt;2.6) galaxies are studied separately. when compared to the control sample, the outer stellar populations of the majority of hi-rich early-type galaxies are shifted in the colourcolour plane along a locus consistent with younger stellar ages, but similar metallicities. the outer colours of hi-rich late-type galaxies are much bluer in r-z than the hi-rich early types, and we infer that they have outer disks which are both younger and more metal-poor. we then proceed to analyze the galaxy environments of hi-rich galaxies on scales of 500 kpc. hi-rich early-type galaxies with low (log m* &lt; 10.5) stellar masses differ significantly from the control sample in that they are more likely to be central rather than satellite systems. their satellites are also less massive and have younger stellar populations. similar, but weaker effects are found for low mass hi-rich late-type galaxies. in addition, we find that the satellites of hi-rich late-types exhibit a greater tendency to align along the major axis of the primary. no environmental differences are found for massive (log m* &gt; 10.5) hi-rich galaxies, regardless of type. \\n  modelling the distribution of neutral hydrogen (hi) in dark matter halos is important for studying galaxy evolution in the cosmological context. we use a novel approach to infer the hi-dark matter connection at the massive end (m_{\\\\rm hi} &gt; 10^{9.8} m_{\\\\odot}) from radio hi emission surveys, using optical properties of low-redshift galaxies as an intermediary. in particular, we use a previously calibrated optical hod describing the luminosity- and colour-dependent clustering of sdss galaxies and describe the hi content using a statistical scaling relation between the optical properties and hi mass. this allows us to compute the abundance and clustering properties of hi-selected galaxies and compare with data from the alfalfa survey. we apply an mcmc-based statistical analysis to constrain the free parameters related to the scaling relation. the resulting best-fit scaling relation identifies massive hi galaxies primarily with optically faint blue centrals, consistent with expectations from galaxy formation models. we compare the hi-stellar mass relation predicted by our model with independent observations from matched hi-optical galaxy samples, finding reasonable agreement. as a further application, we make some preliminary forecasts for future observations of hi and optical galaxies in the expected overlap volume of ska and euclidlsst. \\n  leo t is the lowest mass gas-rich galaxy currently known and studies of its gas content help us understand how such marginal galaxies survive and form stars. we present deep neutral hydrogen (hi) observations from the westerbork synthesis radio telescope in order to understand its hi distribution and potential for star formation. we find a larger hi line flux than the previously accepted value, resulting in a 50% larger hi mass of 4.1 x 10^5 msun. the additional hi flux is from low surface brightness emission that was previously missed; with careful masking this emission can be recovered even in shallower data. we perform a gaussian spectral decomposition to find a cool neutral medium component (cnm) with a mass of 3.7 x 10^4 msun, or almost 10% of the total hi mass. leo t has no hi emission extending from the main hi body, but there is evidence of interaction with the milky way circumgalactic medium in both a potential truncation of the hi body and the offset of the peak hi distribution from the optical center. the cnm component of leo t is large when compared to other dwarf galaxies, even though leo t is not currently forming stars and has a lower star formation efficiency than other gas-rich dwarf galaxies. however, the hi column density associated with the cnm component in leo t is low. one possible explanation is the large cnm component is not related to star formation potential but rather a recent, transient phenomenon related to the interaction of leo t with the milky way circumgalactic medium. \\n  to investigate the effects the cluster environment has on late-type galaxies (ltgs) we studied hi perturbation signatures for all abell 1367 ltgs with hi detections. we used new vla hi observations combined with ages single dish blind survey data. our study indicates that the asymmetry between the high-and low-velocity wings of the characteristic double-horn integrated hi spectrum as measured by the asymmetry parameter, aflux, can be a useful diagnostic for ongoing andor recent hi stripping. 26% of a1367 ltgs have an aflux ratio, more asymmetrical than 3 times the 1{\\\\sigma} spread in the aflux ratio distribution of an undisturbed sample of isolated galaxies (2%) and samples from other denser environments (10% to 20%). over half of the a 1367 ltgs, which are members of groups or pairs, have an aflux ratio larger than twice the 1 {\\\\sigma} spread found in the isolated sample. this suggests inter-grouppair interactions could be making a significant contribution to the ltgs displaying such aflux ratios. the study also demonstrates that the definition of the hi offset from the optical centre of ltgs is resolution dependent, suggesting that unresolved ages hi offsets that are significantly larger than the pointing uncertainties (&gt; 2 {\\\\sigma}) reflect interactions which have asymmetrically displaced significant masses of lower density hi, while having minimal impact on the location of the highest density hi in resolved maps. the distribution of aflux from a comparable sample of virgo galaxies provides a clear indication that the frequency of hi profile perturbations is lower than in a 1367. \\n  we have measured the relationships between hi mass, stellar mass and star formation rate using the hi parkes all sky-survey catalogue (hicat) and the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). of the 3,513 hicat sources, we find 3.4 micron counterparts for 2,896 sources (80%) and provide new wise matched aperture photometry for these galaxies. for our principal sample of spiral galaxies with w1 \\\\le 10 mag and z \\\\le 0.01, we identify hi detections for 93% of the sample. we measure lower hi-stellar mass relationships that hi selected samples that do not include spiral galaxies with little hi gas. our observations of the spiral sample show that hi mass increases with stellar mass with a power-law index 0.35; however, this value is dependent on t-type, which affects both the median and the dispersion of hi mass. we also observe an upper limit on the hi gas fraction, which is consistent with a halo spin parameter model. we measure the star formation efficiency of spiral galaxies to be constant 10^{-9.57} yr^{-1} \\\\pm 0.4 dex for 2.5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass, despite the higher stellar mass spiral showing evidence of quenched star formation. \\n  as a basic step for establishing the co-line tully-fisher relation for distant galaxies, we made a comparative study of hi versus co line profiles. total line profiles of the co line emission from 32 galaxies have been compared with the corresponding hi emission. we found a good correlation between the profiles of co and hi. this strongly supports the thesis that co can be used in the tully-fisher relation for distant galaxies where hi observations cannot reach. we also argue that co can be used as an alternative to hi for un-isolated galaxies such as those in dense cluster of galaxies. using the b-magnitudes and a recent calibration of the hi tully-fisher relation, we give the distances for the galaxies derived from the co-line tully-fisher relation and compare them with the corresponding hi distances. \\n  analyses of qso absorption lines are showing that hi content has evolved over the redshift range z=5 to z= 0. the 21cm line measurements of the z=0 hi content avoid several biases inherent in the absorption line technique, such as the influence of evolving dust content in the absorbers, and will produce a reliable measure to anchor theories of galaxy evolution. examples of important questions to be addressed by local hi surveys are: (1) is there a significant population of gas-rich galaxies or intergalactic clouds that are missing from the census of optically selected galaxies? (2) is there an adequate reservoir of neutral gas to substantially prolong star formation at its present rate? and (3) are there massive objects of such low hi column density that they can have escaped detection in the ``unbiased\\'\\' hi surveys that have been conducted so far? \\n  we report on vla hi spectral line observations of five early-type galaxies classified as optically peculiar due to the presence of jets, ripples or other optical \"fine structure\". we detect hi within the primary beam (30\\' hpbw) in four of the five systems. however, in only one case is this gas associated with the targeted elliptical galaxy. in the other cases the hi is associated with a nearby gas-rich disk or dwarf galaxy. the one hi detection is for ngc 7626, where we tentatively detect an hi cloud lying between 20 and 40 kpc southwest of the galaxy center. its origin is unclear. our failure to detect obvious tidal hi features suggests that if these fine-structure ellipticals are remnants of disk galaxy mergers, either the progenitors were gas poor, or they are well evolved and any gaseous tidal features have dispersed andor been converted into other phases. our targeted systems all reside in groups or clusters, and it seems likely that tidal hi is shorter lived in these environments than suggested by studies of more isolated merger remnants. \\n  multiple sn explosions in disk galaxies efficiently evacuate gas and form cavities with the sizes and shapes of the surrounding envelopes determined by the total amount of injected energy and by the initial gas distribution. such cavities are seen as hi holes when observed in face-on galaxies. gas hydrodynamics simulations are performed to obtain the quantitative characteristics of hi holes that could serve for the determination of the gas vertical scale height and the corresponding dark matter content and its distribution. among these characteristics is the ratio of the maximum column density in the hi ring surrounding the hole to the background hi column density and the vertical expansion velocity of gas in the hi ring. we show that in some cases the extragalactic background ionizing radiation may produce hi holes in the outer regions of galaxies, and can account for the existence of hi holes in nearby face-on galaxies with the apparent lack of an underlying stellar population. \\n  we simulate the distribution of neutral hydrogen (hi) at the redshifts z=1.3 and 3.4 using a cosmological n-body simulation along with a prescription for assigning hi masses to the particles. the hi is distributed in clouds whose properties are consistent with those of the damped lyman-\\\\alpha absorption systems (dlas) seen in quasar spectra. the clustering properties of these clouds are identical to those of the dark matter. we use this to simulate the redshifted hi emission expected at 610 mhz and 325 mhz, two of the observing bands a the gmrt. these are used to predict the correlations expected between the complex visibilities measured at different baselines and frequencies in radio-interferometric observations with the gmrt. the visibility correlations directly probe the power spectrum of hi fluctuations at the epoch when the hi emission originated, and this holds the possibility of using hi observations to study large-scale structures at high z. \\n  as part of our study on the impact of violent star formation on the interstellar medium (ism) of dwarf galaxies, we report observations of neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) in the post-starburst dwarf galaxy ngc 1569. high-resolution measurements with the vla (b-, c- and d-array) are aimed at identifying morphological and kinematical signatures in the hi caused by the starburst. our kinematical data suggest a huge hole in the hi distribution, probably due to the large number of supernovae explosions in the center of the galaxy over the past 20 myr. investigating the large-scale hi structure, we confirm the existence of a possible hi companion and a so-called hi bridge east of ngc 1569. furthermore, we report the detection of additional low-intensity hi halo emission, which leads us to suggest a revised halo structure. based on the new picture, we discuss the origin of the halo gas and possible implications for the evolution of the starburst in ngc 1569. \\n  we present a deep giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) search for hi 21 cm emission from three dwarf galaxies, viz. pox 186, sc 24 and kkr 25. based, in part, on previous single dish hi observations, these galaxies have been classified as a bcd, a dwarf irregular and a transition galaxy respectively. however, in conflict with previous single dish detections, we do not detect hi in sc 24 or kkr 25. we suggest that the previous single dish measurements were probably confused with the local galactic emission. in the case of pox 186, we confirm the previous non detection of hi but with substantially improved limits on its hi mass. our derived upper limits on the hi mass of sc 24 and kkr 25 are similar to the typical hi mass limit for dwarf spheroidal galaxies, whereas in the case of pox 186, we find that its gas content is somewhat smaller than is typical of bcd galaxies. \\n  we present the result of investigations into two theories to explain the star formation rate-density relationship. for regions of high galaxy density, either there are fewer star forming galaxies, or galaxies capable of forming stars are present but some physical process is suppressing their star formation. we use hi parkes all sky survey\\'s (hipass) hi detected galaxies and infrared and radio fluxes to investigate star formation rates and efficiencies with respect to local surface density. for nearby (vel&lt;10000 km\\\\s) hi galaxies we find a strong correlation between hi mass and star formation rate. the number of hi galaxies decreases with increasing local surface density. for hi galaxies (1000&lt;vel&lt;6000 km\\\\s) there is no significant change in the star formation rate or the efficiency of star formation with respect to local surface density. we conclude the sfr-density relation is due to a decrease in the number of hi star forming galaxies in regions of high galaxy density and not to the suppression of star formation. \\n  we discuss the scientific contributions of edsger wybe dijkstra, his opinions and his legacy. \\n  sir arthur eddington is considered one of the greatest astrophysicist of the twentieth century and yet he gained a stigma when, in the 1930s, he embarked on a quest to develop a unified theory of gravity and quantum mechanics. his attempts ultimately proved fruitless and he was unfortunately partially shunned by some physicists in the latter portion of his career. in addition some historians have been less than kind to him regarding this portion of his work. however, detailed analysis of how this work got started shows that eddington\\'s theories were not as outlandish as they are often purported to be. his entire theory rested on the use of quantum mechanical methods of uncertainty in the reference frames of relativity. though the work was ultimately not fruitful, in hindsight it did foreshadow several later results in physics and his methods were definitely rigorous. in addition, his philosophy regarding determinism and uncertainty was actually fairly orthodox for his time. this work begins by looking at eddington\\'s life and philosophy and uses this as a basis to explore his work with uncertainty. \\n  i first met leo breiman in 1979 at the beginning of his third career, professor of statistics at berkeley. he obtained his phd with lo\\\\\\'eve at berkeley in 1957. his first career was as a probabilist in the mathematics department at ucla. after distinguished research, including the shannon--breiman--macmillan theorem and getting tenure, he decided that his real interest was in applied statistics, so he resigned his position at ucla and set up as a consultant. before doing so he produced two classic texts, probability, now reprinted as a siam classic in applied mathematics, and statistics. both books reflected his strong opinion that intuition and rigor must be combined. he expressed this in his probability book which he viewed as a combination of his learning the right hand of probability, rigor, from lo\\\\\\'eve, and the left-hand, intuition, from david blackwell. \\n  we combine high resolution n-body simulations with deep observations of neutral hydrogen (hi) in nearby galaxy groups in order to explore two well-known theories of hi cloud formation: hi stripping by galaxy interactions and dark matter minihalos with embedded hi gas. this paper presents new data from three galaxy groups, canes venatici i, ngc 672, and ngc 45, and assembles data from our previous galaxy group campaign to generate a rich hi cloud archive to compare to our simulated data.   we find no hi clouds in the canes venatici i, ngc 672, or ngc 45 galaxy groups. we conclude that hi clouds in our detection space are most likely to be generated through recent, strong galaxy interactions. we find no evidence of hi clouds associated with dark matter halos above m_hi = 10^6 m_sun, within +- 700 kms of galaxies, and within 50 kpc projected distance of galaxies. \\n  we present a detailed analysis of the neutral hydrogen kinematics of 12 nearby dwarf irregular galaxies observed as part of the local volume hi survey (lvhis) conducted at the australia telescope compact array. for each galaxy we measure the disk parameters (inclination, position angle) and the hi rotation curve. six galaxies in our sample (am0605-341, argo dwarf, eso059-g001, eso137-g018, eso174-g?001, eso308-g022) have their atomic hydrogen distribution studied for the first time. am0605-341 was found to have an extension of redshifted hi which we propose is due to a tidal interaction with ngc2188. there is evidence that eso215-g?009 has extraplanar hi gas. we also compare the global galaxy properties, in particular the integrated hi flux density and velocity widths of the observed hi spectra with the results from the low angular resolution hi parkes all sky survey (hipass). we discuss under what circumstances the 21cm emission line profile can accurately predict the galaxy\\'s rotation velocity, an observational parameter crucial to study the classical and baryonic tully-fisher relations. \\n  in the 1930s the german physicist erich regener (1881-1955) did important work on the measurement of the rate of production of ionisation deep under-water and in the atmosphere. he discovered, along with one of his students, georg pfotzer, the altitude at which the production of ionisation in the atmosphere reaches a maximum, often, but misleadingly, called the pfotzer maximum. regener was one of the first to estimate the energy density of cosmic rays, an estimate that was used by baade and zwicky to bolster their postulate that supernovae might be their source. yet regener\\'s name is less recognised by present-day cosmic ray physicists than it should be largely because in 1937 he was forced to take early retirement by the national socialists as his wife had jewish ancestors. in this paper we briefly review his work on cosmic rays and recommend an alternative naming of the ionisation maximum. the influence that regener had on the field through his son, his son-in-law, his grandsons and his students and through his links with rutherford\\'s group in cambridge is discussed in an appendix. regener was nominated for the nobel prize in physics by schroedinger in 1938. he died in 1955 at the age of 73. \\n  academic biography of karl weierstrass, his basic works, influence of his doctrine on the development of mathematics. \\n  we present a model of interacting multiple choices of opinions. at each step of the process, a listener is persuaded by hisher neighbour, the lobbyist, to modify hisher opinion on two different choices of event. whether or not the listener will be convinced by the lobbyist depends on the difference between hisher opinion with that of the lobbyist, and with that of the revealed social opinion (the social pressure). if the listener is convinced, heshe will modify hisher opinion and update hisher revealed preference, and proceed to persuade hisher next neighbour. if the listener is not convinced by the lobbyist, heshe will retain hisher revealed preference, and try to persuade the lobbyist to change hisher opinion. in this case, the direction of opinion propagation is reversed. a consensus is reached when all the revealed preference is the same. our numerical results show that consensus can always be attained in this model. however, the time needed to achieve consensus, or the so-called convergence time, is longer if the listener is more concerned with the public opinion, or is less likely to be influenced by the lobbyist. \\n  we present alfalfa hi observations of a well studied region of the leo cloud, which includes the ngc 3227 group and the ngc 3190 group. we detect optically dark hi tails and plumes with extents potentially exceeding 600 kpc, well beyond the field of view of previous observations. these hi features contain approximately 40% of the total hi mass in the ngc~3227 group and 10% in the ngc~3190 group. we also present wsrt maps which show the complex morphology of the extended emission in the ngc~3227 group. we comment on previously proposed models of the interactions in these groups and the implications for the scale of group processing through interactions. motivated by the extent of the hi plumes, we place the hi observations in the context of the larger loose group, demonstrating the need for future sensitive, wide field hi surveys to understand the role of group processing in galaxy evolution. \\n  we characterize the column density probability distributions functions (pdfs) of the atomic hydrogen gas, hi, associated with seven galactic molecular clouds (mcs). we use 21 cm observations from the leidenargentinebonn galactic hi survey to derive column density maps and pdfs. we find that the peaks of the hi pdfs occur at column densities ranging from ~1-2\\\\times 10^{21} cm^2 (equivalently, ~0.5-1 mag). the pdfs are uniformly narrow, with a mean dispersion of \\\\sigma_{hi}\\\\approx 10^{20} cm^2 (~0.1 mag). we also investigate the hi-to-h_2 transition towards the cloud complexes and estimate hi surface densities ranging from 7-16 m_\\\\odot pc^{-2} at the transition. we propose that the hi pdf is a fitting tool for identifying the hi-to-h_2 transition column in galactic mcs. \\n  we investigate maxwell\\'s attempt to justify the mathematical assumptions behind his 1860 proposition iv according to which the velocity components of colliding particles follow the normal distribution. contrary to the commonly held view we find that his molecular collision model plays a crucial role in reaching this conclusion, and that his model assumptions also permit inference to equalization of mean kinetic energies (temperatures), which is what he intended to prove in his discredited and widely ignored proposition vi. if we take a charitable reading of his own proof of proposition vi then it was maxwell, and not boltzmann, who gave the first proof of a tendency towards equilibrium, a sort of h-theorem. we also call attention to a potential conflation of notions of probabilistic and value independence in relevant prior works of his contemporaries and of his own, and argue that this conflation might have impacted his adoption of the suspect independence assumption of proposition iv. \\n'"
