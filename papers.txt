  we have experimentally investigated the fracture process in  samples submitted to a uniaxial force. five types of  sheets (newsprint, towel, sulfite, silk and couche s) were fractured along two orthogonal orientations. in order to characterize the rupture lines of the  sheets we utilized the hurst exponent. our results indicate a dependence of the hurst exponent on the orientation of the  sheets for samples of newsprint and, probably, towel and silk s. for the other types of  the hurst exponent does not depend on the direction of crack propagation.

  as more and more academic s are being submitted to conferences and journals, evaluating all these s by professionals is time-consuming and can cause inequality due to the personal factors of the reviewers. in this , in order to assist professionals in evaluating academic s, we propose a novel task: automatic academic  rating (aapr), which automatically determine whether to accept academic s. we build a new dataset for this task and propose a novel modularized hierarchical convolutional neural network to achieve automatic academic  rating. evaluation results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines by a large margin. the dataset and code are available at \url{https:github.comlancopkuaapr}

  naively, one would expect longer s to have larger impact (i.e., to be cited more). i tested this expectation by selecting all (~30,000) refereed s from a&amp;a, aj, apj and mnras published between 2000 and 2004. these particular years were chosen so s analyzed would not be too "fresh", but at the same time length of each article could be obtained via ads. i find that indeed longer s published in these four major astronomy journals are on average cited more, with a median number of citations increasing from 6 for articles 2-3 pages long to about 50 for articles ~50 pages long. i do however observe a significant "letters effect", i.e. apj and a&amp;a articles 4 pages long are cited more than articles 5-10 pages long. also, the very few longest (&gt;80 pages) s are actually cited less than somewhat shorter s. for individual journals, median citations per  increase from 11 for ~9,300 a&amp;a s to 14 for ~5,300 mnras s, 16 for ~2,550 aj s, and 20 for ~12,850 apj s (including apj letters and supplement). i conclude with some semi-humorous career advice, directed especially at first-year graduate students. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author because the result of this  was already obtained. 
  traditionally, the number of citations that a scholarly  receives from other s is used as the proxy of its scientific impact. yet citations can come from domains outside the scientific community, and one such example is through patented technologies--- can be cited by patents, achieving technological impact. while the scientific impact of s has been extensively studied, the technological aspect remains less known in the literature. here we aim to fill this gap by presenting a comparative study on how 919 thousand biomedical s are cited by u.s. patents and by other s over time. we observe a positive correlation between citations from patents and from s, but there is little overlap between the two domains in either the most cited s, or s with the most delayed recognition. we also find that the two types of citations exhibit distinct temporal variations, with patent citations lagging behind  citations for a median of 6 years for the majority of s. our work contributes to the understanding of the technological impact of s. 
  following my previous study of  length vs. number of citations in astronomy (stanek 2008), some colleagues expressed an interest in knowing if any correlation exists between citations and the number of authors on an astronomical . at least naively, one would expect s with more authors to be cited more. i test this expectation with the same sample of s as analyzed in stanek (2008), selecting all (~30,000) refereed s from a&amp;a, aj, apj and mnras published between 2000 and 2004. (...) i find that indeed s with more authors are on average cited more, but only weakly so: roughly, the number of citations doubles with ten-fold increase in the number of authors. while the median number of citations to a 2 author  is 17, the median number of citations to a  with 10 to 20 authors is 32. i find that most of the s are written by a small number of authors, with a mode of 2 authors and a median of 3 authors. i also find that s with more authors are not longer than s with fewer authors, in fact a median number of 8 to 10 pages per  holds for any number of authors. for the same sample of s, a median number of citations per  grew from 15 in june 2008 (stanek 2008) to 19 in november 2009. unlike stanek (2008), i do not conclude with any career advice, semi-humorous or otherwise. 
  wigner's 1939  on representations of the inhomogeneous lorentz group is one of the most fundamental s in physics. wigner maintained his passion for this subject throughout his life. in this , i will review the s which he published with me on this subject. these s deal with the question of unifying the internal space-time symmetries of massive and massless particles.

  in this  we give a proof of the existence of global regular solutions to the fourier transformed navier-stokes system with small initial data in \phi(2) via an iteration argument. the proof of the regularity theorem is a minor modification of the proof given in the  "some elementary estimates for the navier-stokes system". so this  is intended to be just a complement to the afore mentioned . 
  since the publication of robert k. merton's theory of cumulative advantage in science (matthew effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its presence at the level of s, individual researchers, institutions or countries. however, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic "quality" of s or of researchers--"better" (however defined) s or researchers could receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. using an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of s--identical duplicate s published in different journals with different impact factors--this  shows that the journal in which s are published have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate s published in high impact journals obtain, on average, twice as much citations as their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact factors. the intrinsic value of a  is thus not the only reason a given  gets cited or not; there is a specific matthew effect attached to journals and this gives to  published there an added value over and above their intrinsic quality. 
  the author decided to withdraw this  by 1) an error in lemma 5.11 (and 5.12) which requires some justification; 2) the main result of this  suffers overlap with arxiv:1203.5254; 3) the author decided to split arxiv:1203.5254 into two pieces, and the main application of this  is transferred to one of them (in order to keep strength of the applications presented in each ); and 4) thus a "newer version" of this  would have different story and substantially different contents, which he feels a different . 
  this  starts from the configuration space of a degree-4 single-vertex creased , and develops a sufficient and necessary condition for a quadrilateral creased  to be rigid-foldable. by introducing two more useful sufficient conditions that only depend on the sector angles, we are able to generate two families of rigid-foldable quadrilateral creased s. all such creased s have one degree of freedom in each branch of their rigid folding motion. for each family of quadrilateral creased  the total design freedoms and possible rigid folding motions are analyzed. 
  as the number of people who use scientific literature databases grows, the demand for literature retrieval services has been steadily increased. one of the most popular retrieval services is to find a set of s similar to the  under consideration, which requires a measure that computes similarities between s. scientific literature databases exhibit two interesting characteristics that are different from general databases. first, the s cited by old s are often not included in the database due to technical and economic reasons. second, since a  references the s published before it, few s cite recently-published s. these two characteristics cause all existing similarity measures to fail in at least one of the following cases: (1) measuring the similarity between old, but similar s, (2) measuring the similarity between recent, but similar s, and (3) measuring the similarity between two similar s: one old, the other recent. in this , we propose a new link-based similarity measure called c-rank, which uses both in-link and out-link by disregarding the direction of references. in addition, we discuss the most suitable normalization method for scientific literature databases and propose an evaluation method for measuring the accuracy of similarity measures. we have used a database with real-world s from dblp and their reference information crawled from libra for experiments and compared the performance of c-rank with those of existing similarity measures. experimental results show that c-rank achieves a higher accuracy than existing similarity measures.

  we present an analysis of the s published in the journals nature and science in the years from 2006 to 2010. during this period, a total of 7788 s were published in the two journals. this includes 544 astronomy s that comprise 7.0% of the s in `all' research fields and 18.9% of those in the fields of `physical sciences'. the sub-fields of research of the astronomy s are distributed, in descending order of number of s, in solar system, stellar astronomy, galaxies and the universe, the milky way galaxy, and exoplanets. the observational facilities used for the studies are mainly ground-based telescopes (31.1%), spacecrafts (27.0%), and space telescopes (22.8%), while 16.0% of s did not use any noticeable facilities and 1.7% used other facilities. korean scientists have published 86 s (33 in nature and 53 in science), which is 1.10% of all the s (n=7788) in the two journals. the share of s by korean astronomers among the scientific s by koreans is 8.14%, slightly higher than the contribution of astronomy s (7.0%) in both journals.

  this  is a natural continuation of  "on rectifiable spaces and its algebraical equivalents, topological algebraic systems and mal'cev algebras" published in arxiv:1309.4572. thus we justify the need to present the entire material in an unified manner. this  is the continuation of section 6 from the first . it specifies and corrects the roughest mistakes, incorrect statements and nonsense of the introduced concepts, which are available in numerous s on topological algebraic systems, basically in s of academician choban m. m. and his disciples. 
  evaluating and comparing the academic performance of a journal, a researcher or a single  has long remained a critical, necessary but also controversial issue. most of existing metrics invalidate comparison across different fields of science or even between different types of s in the same field. this  proposes a new metric, called return on citation (roc), which is simply a citation ratio but applies to evaluating the , the journal and the researcher in a consistent way, allowing comparison across different fields of science and between different types of s and discouraging unnecessary and coerciveself-citation. 
  a directed curve is a possibly singular curve with well-defined tangent lines along the curve. then the tangent surface to a directed curve is naturally defined as the ruled surface by tangent geodesics to the curve, whenever any affine connection is endowed with the ambient space. in this  the local diffeomorphism classification is completed for generic directed curves. then it turns out that the swallowtails and open swallowtails appear generically for the classification on singularities of tangent surfaces. 
  the scientific  output of the united nations university (unu) was bibliometrically analysed.it was found that (i) a noticeable continous  output starts in 1995, (ii) about 65% of the research s have been published as international cooperations and 18% as single-authored s, (iv) the research s rank above world average according to pudovkin-garfield percentile rank index, and (v)  content indicate the wide variety of scientific topics unu has been and is working on. 
  in research evaluation of single researchers, the assessment of  and journal impact is of interest. high journal impact reflects the ability of researchers to convince strict reviewers, and high  impact reflects the usefulness of s for future research. in many bibliometric studies, metrics for journal and  impact are separately presented. in this , we introduce two graph types, which combine both metrics in a single graph. the graphs can be used in research evaluation to visualize the performance of single researchers comprehensively.

  the rock--scissors game, commonly played in east asia, gives a simple model to understand physical, biological, psychological and other problems. the interacting rock--scissors particle system is a point of contact between the kinetic theory of gases by maxwell and boltzmann ( collision model) and the coagulation theory by smoluchowski ( coalescence model). a 2s+1 types extended rock--scissors collision model naturally introduces a nonlinear integrable system. the time evolution of the 2s+1 types extended rock--scissors coalescence model is obtained from the logarithmic time change of the nonlinear integrable system. we also discuss the behavior of a discrete rock--scissors coalescence model.

  as the subject of research excellence has received increasing attention (in science policy) over the last few decades, increasing numbers of bibliometric studies have been published dealing with excellent s. however, many different methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent s. the present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out in order to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an "average" or "most frequent" bibliometric practice. the search in the web of science yielded 321 s dealing with "highly cited", "most cited", "top cited" and "most frequently cited". of the 321 s, 16 could not be used in this study. in around 80% of the s analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition has been provided with which to identify excellent s. with definitions which relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited s (58%) or s with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). around 23% worked with percentile rank classes. over these s, there is an arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3% (median). the top 1% is used most frequently in the s, followed by the top 10%. with the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be possible to identify excellent s based on an "average" or "most frequent" practice among bibliometricians.

  the article presents three advanced citation-based methods used to detect potential breakthrough s among very highly cited s. we approach the detection of such s from three different perspectives in order to provide different typologies of breakthrough s. in all three cases we use the classification of scientific publications developed at cwts based on direct citation relationships. this classification establishes clusters of s at three levels of aggregation. s are clustered based on their similar citation orientations and it is assumed that they are focused on similar research interests. we use the clustering as the context for detecting potential breakthrough s. we utilize the characteristics scores and scales (css) approach to partition citation distributions and implement a specific filtering algorithm to sort out potential highly-cited followers, s not considered breakthroughs in themselves. after invoking thresholds and filtering, three methods are explored: a very exclusive one where only the highest cited  in a micro-cluster is considered as a potential breakthrough  (m1); as well as two conceptually different methods, one that detects potential breakthrough s among the two percent highest cited s according to css (m2a), and finally a more restrictive version where, in addition to the css two percent filter, knowledge diffusion is also taken in as an extra parameter (m2b). the advance citation-based methods are explored and evaluated using specifically validated publication sets linked to different danish funding instruments including centres of excellence.

  in an earlier , tatong and suvarnamani explores the diophantine equation p^x + p^y = z^2 for a prime number p. in that  they find some solutions to the equation for p=2, 3. in this , we look at a general version of this equation and solve it completely. 
  research must be reproducible in order to make an impact on science and to contribute to the body of knowledge in our field. yet studies have shown that 70% of research from academic labs cannot be reproduced. in software engineering, and more specifically requirements engineering (re), reproducible research is rare, with datasets not always available or methods not fully described. this lack of reproducible research hinders progress, with researchers having to replicate an experiment from scratch. a researcher starting out in re has to sift through conference s, finding ones that are empirical, then must look through the data available from the empirical  (if any) to make a preliminary determination if the  can be reproduced. this  addresses two parts of that problem, identifying re s and identifying empirical s within the re s. recent re and empirical conference s were used to learn features and to build an automatic classifier to identify re and empirical s. we introduce the empirical requirements research classifier (errc) method, which uses natural language processing and machine learning to perform supervised classification of conference s. we compare our method to a baseline keyword-based approach. to evaluate our approach, we examine sets of s from the ieee requirements engineering conference and the ieee international symposium on software testing and analysis. we found that the errc method performed better than the baseline method in all but a few cases.

  s that are posted to a digital preprint archive are typically cited twice as often as s that are not posted. this has been demonstrated for s published in a wide variety of journals, and in many different subfields of astronomy. most astronomers now use the arxiv.org server (astro-ph) to distribute preprints, but the solar physics community has an independent archive hosted at montana state university. for several samples of solar physics s published in 2003, i quantify the boost in citation rates for preprints posted to each of these servers. i show that s on the msu archive typically have citation rates 1.7 times higher than the average of similar s that are not posted as preprints, while those posted to astro-ph get 2.6 times the average. a comparable boost is found for s published in conference proceedings, suggesting that the higher citation rates are not the result of self-selection of above-average s.

  this  is the sequel of the  "continuity of volumes on arithmetic varieties", in which we established the arithmetic volume function of smooth hermitian q-invertible sheaves and proved its continuity. the continuity of the volume function has a lot of applications as treated in the  as above. in this , we would like to consider its continuous extension over r. 
  the issue of duplicate publications has received a lot of attention in the medical literature, but much less in the information science community. this  aims at analyzing the prevalence and scientific impact of duplicate publications across all fields of research between 1980 and 2007, using a definition of duplicate s based on their metadata. it shows that in all fields combined, the prevalence of duplicates is one out of two-thousand s, but is higher in the natural and medical sciences than in the social sciences and humanities. a very high proportion (&gt;85%) of these s are published the same year or one year apart, which suggest that most duplicate s were submitted simultaneously. furthermore, duplicate s are generally published in journals with impact factors below the average of their field and obtain a lower number of citations. this  provides clear evidence that the prevalence of duplicate s is low and, more importantly, that the scientific impact of such s is below average.

  in this , we study the (k,l)-stable vector bundles over non-singular projective curve x of genus g\geq 2, its relation with stability and segre invariants. for rank 2 and 3, we give an explicit description and relation of (k,l)-stability and brill-noether loci. 
  this note was an attempt to complete a gap in the proof of theorem 11.1 of the  arxiv:1111.5992. due to a critical gap in the proof of lemma 4.3, this  is withdrawn. 
  comments are special types of publications whose aim is to correct or criticize previously published s. for this reason, comments are believed to make commented s less worthy or trusty to the eyes of the scientific community, and thus predestined to have low scientific impact. here, we show that such belief is not supported by empirical evidence. we consider thirteen major publication outlets in science, and perform systematic comparisons between the citations accumulated by commented and non commented articles. we find that (i) commented s are, on average, much more cited than non commented s, and (ii) commented s are more likely to be among the most cited s of a journal. since comments are published soon after criticized s, comments should be viewed as early indicators of the future impact of criticized s. 
  this  includes notes to accompany a reading of thue's 1914  "probleme uber veranderungen von zeichenreihen nach gegebenen reglen", along with a translation of that . thue's 1914  is mainly famous for proving an early example of an undecidable problem, cited prominently by post. however, post's  principally makes use of the definition of thue systems, described on the first two pages of thue's , and does not depend on the more specific results in the remainder of thue's . a closer study of the remaining parts of that  highlight a number of important s in the history of computing: the transition from algebra to formal language theory, the analysis of the "computational power" (in a pre-1936 sense) of rules, and the development of algorithms to generate rule-sets. 
  in an article written five years ago [arxiv:0809.0522], we described a method for predicting which scientific s will be highly cited in the future, even if they are currently not highly cited. applying the method to real citation data we made predictions about s we believed would end up being well cited. here we revisit those predictions, five years on, to see how well we did. among the over 2000 s in our original data set, we examine the fifty that, by the measures of our previous study, were predicted to do best and we find that they have indeed received substantially more citations in the intervening years than other s, even after controlling for the number of prior citations. on average these top fifty s have received 23 times as many citations in the last five years as the average  in the data set as a whole, and 15 times as many as the average  in a randomly drawn control group that started out with the same number of citations. applying our prediction technique to current data, we also make new predictions of s that we believe will be well cited in the next few years. 
  h-index has become the most popular indicator for quantifying a scientist's scientific impact in various scientific fields. h-index is defined as the largest number of s with citation number larger than or equal to h and it treats each citation equally. however, different citations usually come from different s with different influence and quality, and a citation from a highly influential  is a greater recognition of the target  than a citation from an ordinary . based on this assumption, we proposed a new indicator named x-index to quantify a scientist's scientific impact by considering only the citations coming from influential s. x-index is defined as the largest number of s with influential citation number larger than or equal to x, where each influential citation comes from a  for which the average acnpp (average citation number per ) of its authors larger than or equal to x . through analysis on the aps dataset, we find that the proposed x-index has much better ability to discriminate between physics prize winners and ordinary physicists. 
  in this  we obtain new theorems about classes of exceptional sets for the selberg's theorem c (1942). our theorems, as based on discrete method, are not accessible for karatsuba's theory (1984) since this theory is a continuous theory. this  is english version of our  \cite{8}, the results of our  \cite{9} are added too. 
  a weakly distance-regular digraph is quasi-thin if the maximum value of its intersection numbers is 2. in this , we show that the valency of any commutative quasi-thin weakly distance-regular digraph is at most 6. 
  this  is part of a series of s where an arithmetic analogue of classical differential geometry is being developed. in this arithmetic differential geometry functions are replaced by integer numbers, derivations are replaced by fermat quotient operators, and connections (respectively curvature) are replaced by certain adelic (respectively global) objects attached to symmetric matrices with integral coefficients. previous s were devoted to an arithmetic analogue of the chern connection. the present  is devoted to an arithmetic analogue of the levi-civita connection. 
  during eugene garfield's (eg's) lengthy career as information scientist, he published about 1,500 s. in this study, we use the impressive oeuvre of eg to introduce a new type of bibliometric networks: keyword co-occurrences networks based on the context of citations, which are referenced in a certain  set (here: the s published by eg). the citation context is defined by the words which are located around a specific citation. we retrieved the citation context from microsoft academic. to interpret and compare the results of the new network type, we generated two further networks: co-occurrence networks which are based on title and abstract keywords from (1) eg's s and (2) the s citing eg's publications. the comparison of the three networks suggests that s of eg and citation contexts of s citing eg are semantically more closely related to each other than to titles and abstracts of s citing eg. this result accords with the use of citations in research evaluation that is based on the premise that citations reflect the cognitive influence of the cited on the citing publication. 
  this  is the last  in a series of five s. building on earlier s in this series, we prove an analogue of kuratowski's characterisation of graph planarity for three dimensions.   more precisely, a simply connected 2-dimensional simplicial complex embeds in 3-space if and only if it has no obstruction from an explicit list of obstructions. this list of obstructions is finite except for one infinite family. 
  this  gives a short survey of some basic results related to estimates of fractional integrals and fourier transforms. it is closely adjoint to our previous survey s \cite{k1998} and \cite{k2007}. the main methods used in the  are based on nonincreasing rearrangements. we give alternative proofs of some results.   we observe also that the  represents the mini-course given by the author at barcelona university in october, 2014. 
  this is an expository  about the  relative thom spectra via operadic kan extensions. 
  we explore the degree to which s prepublished on arxiv garner more citations, in an attempt to paint a sharper picture of fairness issues related to prepublishing. a 's citation count is estimated using a negative-binomial generalized linear model (glm) while observing a binary variable which indicates whether the  has been prepublished. we control for author influence (via the authors' h-index at the time of  writing), publication venue, and overall time that  has been available on arxiv. our analysis only includes s that were eventually accepted for publication at top-tier cs conferences, and were posted on arxiv either before or after the acceptance notification. we observe that s submitted to arxiv before acceptance have, on average, 65\% more citations in the following year compared to s submitted after. we note that this finding is not causal, and discuss possible next steps. 
  graphite has been one of the promising materials in diverse application domains owing to its high conductivity, tunability into different structures and mechanical strength its. the effectiveness of graphite and its derivatives has been studied for electromagnetic domains as well. pencil strokes on  create a film of graphite composites which is ed to be useful for fabrication of electronic components. in our study, we extend use of pencil traces on  for studying its electromagnetic properties. the pencil traces on  is facile method of coating graphite composite films with relatively lower cost and ease of processing. the interaction of electromagnetic wave with graphite composites produces in modulation of the incident rf power. the rf power was observed to get attenuated with pencil coating on  as compared to plain . the attenuation increased with increasing the signal frequency. further, stacking more pencil coated s onto each other results in increasing attenuation factor. additionally, these pencil coated  roll was able to attenuate the incoming noise signals in the radio signal reception. this demonstrates potential ability of pencil coated s to be used for small rf power attenuation applications.

  we studied patterns of authorship in computer science~(cs) research in the philippines by using data mining and graph theory techniques on archives of scientific s presented in the philippine computer science congresses from 2000 to 2010 involving 326~s written by 605~authors. we inferred from these archives various graphs namely, a --author bipartite graph, a co-authorship graph, and two mixing graphs. our results show that the scientific articles by filipino computer scientists were generated at a rate of 33~s per year, while the s were written by an average of 2.64~authors (maximum=13). the frequency distribution of the number of authors per  follows a power-law with a power of \varphi=-2.04 (r^2=0.71). the number of filipino cs researchers increases at an annual rate of 60~new scientists. the researchers have written an average of 1.42~s (maximum=20) and have collaborated with 3.70~other computer scientists (maximum=54). the frequency distribution of the number of s per author follows a power law with \varphi=-1.88 (r^2=0.83). this distribution closely agrees with lotka's {\em law of scientific productivity} having \varphi\approx -2. the number of co-authors per author also follows a power-law with \varphi=-1.65 (r^2=0.80). these results suggest that most cs~s in the country were written by scientists who prefer to work alone or at most in small groups. these also suggest that few s were written by scientists who were involved in large collaboration efforts. the productivity of the philippines' cs researchers, as measured by their number of s, is positively correlated with their participation in collaborative research efforts, as measured by their number of co-authors (pearson r=0.7425). 
  when pagerank began to be used for ranking in web search, a concern soon arose that older pages have an inherent --- and potentially unfair --- advantage over emerging pages of high quality, because they have had more time to acquire hyperlink citations. algorithms were then proposed to compensate for this effect. curiously, in bibliometry, the opposite concern has often been raised: that a growing body of recent s crowds out older s, resulting in a collective amnesia in research communities, which potentially leads to reinventions, redundancies, and missed opportunities to connect ideas. a recent  by verstak et al. ed experiments on google scholar data, which seemed to refute the amnesia, or aging, hypothesis. they claimed that more recently written s have a larger fraction of outbound citations targeting s that are older by a fixed number of years, indicating that ancient s are alive and well-loved and increasingly easily found, thanks in part to google scholar. in this  we show that the full picture is considerably more nuanced. specifically, the fate of a fixed sample of s, as they age, is rather different from what verstak et al.'s study suggests: there is clear and steady abandonment in favor of citations to newer s. the two apparently contradictory views are reconciled by the realization that, as time passes, the number of s older than a fixed number of years grows rapidly. 
  background: many researchers have studied the relationship between diet and health. there are s showing an association between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and type 2 diabetes. many meta-analyses use individual studies that do not adjust for multiple testing or multiple modeling and thus provide biased estimates of effect. hence the claims ed in a meta-analysis  may be unreliable if the primary s do not ensure unbiased estimates of effect. objective: determine the statistical reliability of 10 s and indirectly the reliability of the meta-analysis study. method: ten primary s used in a meta-analysis  and counted the numbers of outcomes, predictors, and covariates. we estimated the size of the potential analysis search space available to the authors of these s; i.e. the number of comparisons and models available. since we noticed that there were differences between predictors and covariates cited in the abstract and in the text, we applied this formula to information found in the abstracts, space a, as well as the text, space t, of each primary . results: the median and range of the number of comparisons possible across the primary s are 6.5 and (2-12,288) for abstracts, and 196,608 and (3,072-117,117,952) the texts. note that the median of 6.5 for space a is misleading as each primary study has 60-165 foods not mentioned in the abstract. conclusion: given that testing is at the 0.05 level and the number of comparisons is very large, nominal statistical significance is very weak support for a claim. the claims in these s are not statistically supported and hence are unreliable. thus, the claims of the meta-analysis  lack evidentiary confirmation. 
  how can we find state-of-the-art s for a given task? is it possible to automatically maintain leaderboards in the form of partial orders between s, based on performance on standard benchmarks? can we detect potential anomalies in s where some metrics improve but others degrade? is citation count of any use in early detection of top-performing s? here we answer these questions, while describing our experience building a new bibliometric system that robustly mines experimental performance from s. we propose a novel performance tournament graph with s as nodes, where edges encode noisy performance comparison information extracted from s. these extractions resemble (noisy) outcomes of matches in an incomplete tournament. had they been complete and perfectly reliable, compiling a ranking would have been trivial. in the face of noisy extractions, we propose several approaches to rank s, identify the best of them, and show that commercial academic search systems fail miserably at finding state-of-the-art s. contradicting faith in a steady march of science, we find widespread existence of cycles in the performance tournament, which expose potential anomalies and reproducibility issues. using widely-used lists of state-of-the-art s in 27 areas of computer science, we demonstrate that our system can effectively build reliable rankings. our code and data sets will be placed in the public domain. 
  this submission consists of two s: 1) an erratum that corrects an error in the proof of proposition 4.3 in my  "the homogeneous coordinate ring of a toric variety", and 2) the original (unchanged) version of the , published in 1995. the original  introduced the homogeneous coordinate ring of a toric variety (now called the total coordinate ring or cox ring) and gave a quotient construction. the  also studied sheaves on a toric variety, and in section 4 described its automorphism group. the error in the proof of proposition 4.3 resulted from the faulty assumption that a certain set of graded endomorphisms forms a ring; rather, it is a monoid under . the erratum notes this error and gives a correct proof of the proposition.

  mathematical models of the scientific citation process predict a strong "first-mover" effect under which the first s in a field will, essentially regardless of content, receive citations at a rate enormously higher than s published later. moreover s are expected to retain this advantage in perpetuity -- they should receive more citations indefinitely, no matter how many other s are published after them. we test this conjecture against data from a selection of fields and in several cases find a first-mover effect of a magnitude similar to that predicted by the theory. were we wearing our cynical hat today, we might say that the scientist who wants to become famous is better off -- by a wide margin -- writing a modest  in next year's hottest field than an outstanding  in this year's. on the other hand, there are some s, albeit only a small fraction, that buck the trend and attract significantly more citations than theory predicts despite having relatively late publication dates. we suggest that s of this kind, though they often receive comparatively few citations overall, are probably worthy of our attention.

  this  analyzes the effect of interdisciplinarity on the scientific impact of individual s. using all the s published in web of science in 2000, we define the degree of interdisciplinarity of a given  as the percentage of its cited references made to journals of other disciplines. we show that, although for all disciplines combined there is no clear correlation between the level of interdisciplinarity of s and their citation rates, there are nonetheless some disciplines in which a higher level of interdisciplinarity is related to a higher citation rates. for other disciplines, citations decline as interdisciplinarity grows. one characteristic is visible in all disciplines: highly disciplinary and highly interdisciplinary s have a low scientific impact. this suggests that there might be an optimum of interdisciplinarity beyond which the research is too dispersed to find its niche and under which it is too mainstream to have high impact. finally, the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific impact is highly determined by the citation characteristics of the disciplines involved: s citing citation intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by those disciplines and, hence, obtain higher citation scores than s citing non citation intensive disciplines.

  we carried out a qualitative study to identify the "missing pieces" in current computing devices and technologies that are preventing people from eliminating  from their lives.   most of the existing literature has looked into the work practices of businesses, while a few have researched how high school and college students and teaching assistants at universities work with . we were specifically interested in analysing  use for people in the research side of academia, and seeing how our results compare to existing work. we recruited and interviewed participants from academia to understand what kind of tasks they use  for, what kind of tasks they use computing devices for and what motivates them to use these two media.   we found that, despite having access to at least one personal computing device, the participants preferred to work with  in many situations. this appears to be attributed to certain intrinsic qualities that  has, such as open format, easy navigation, readability, and the aff?ordances these qualities provide. in order to eventually replace  with devices, designers of new technology will have to successfully emulate these qualities. 
  in this  we describe cyberchair, a web-based groupware application that supports the review process for technical contributions to conferences. cyberchair deals with most administrative tasks that are involved in the review process, such as storing author information, abstracts, (camera-ready) s and reviews. it generates several overviews based on the reviews which support the program committee (pc) in selecting the best s. cyberchair points out conflicting reviews and offers the reviewers means to easily communicate to solve these conflicts. in his  identify the champion, o. nierstrasz describes this review process in terms of a pattern language. cyberchair supports pcs by using these patterns in its implementation.

  since its creation in 1991, arxiv has become central to the diffusion of research in a number of fields. combining data from the entirety of arxiv and the web of science (wos), this  investigates (a) the proportion of s across all disciplines that are on arxiv and the proportion of arxiv s that are in the wos, (b) elapsed time between arxiv submission and journal publication, and (c) the aging characteristics and scientific impact of arxiv e-prints and their published version. it shows that the proportion of wos s found on arxiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics, and that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository. elapsed time between arxiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains longer in mathematics than in physics. in physics, mathematics, as well as in astronomy and astrophysics, arxiv versions are cited more promptly and decay faster than wos s. the arxiv versions of s - both published and unpublished - have lower citation rates than published s, although there is almost no difference in the impact of the arxiv versions of both published and unpublished s.

   featured on the cover of a journal has more visibility in an issue compared with other ordinary articles for both printed and electronic journal. does this kind of visibility guarantee more attention and greater impact of its associated content than the non-cover s? in this research, usage and citation data of 60 issues of plos biology from 2006 to 2010 are analyzed to compare the attention and scholarly impact between cover and non-cover . our empirical study confirms that, in most cases, the group difference between cover and non-cover  is not significant for attention or impact. cover  is not the best one, nor at the upper level in one issue considering the attention or the citation impact. having a  featured on the cover of a journal may be a source of pride to researchers, many institutions and researchers would even release news about it. however, a  being featured on the cover of a journal doesn't guarantee more attention and greater impact. 
  we discuss well known geometric constructions via -folding. the note is written primary for school students. 
  we explain the elekes szabo  in more details and improve the constant in one dimensional case in \mathbb{r} and \mathbb{c}. 
  the number of scientific s grows exponentially in many disciplines. the share of online available s grows as well. at the same time, the period of time for a  to loose at chance to be cited anymore shortens. the decay of the citing rate shows similarity to ultradiffusional processes as for other online contents in social networks. the distribution of s per author shows similarity to the distribution of posts per user in social networks. the rate of uncited s for online available s grows while some s 'go viral' in terms of being cited. summarized, the practice of scientific publishing moves towards the domain of social networks. the goal of this project is to create a text engineering tool, which can semi-automatically categorize a  according to its type of contribution and extract relationships between them into an ontological database. semi-automatic categorization means that the mistakes made by automatic pre-categorization and relationship-extraction will be corrected through a wikipedia-like front-end by volunteers from general public. this tool should not only help researchers and the general public to find relevant supplementary material and peers faster, but also provide more information for research funding agencies. 
  this  gives a first step towards developing synthetic differential geometry within homotopy type theory. its model theory will be discussed in a subsequent . 
  in this  we present some key moments in the history of morita equivalence for operator algebras. 
  the aim of writing this  is given in the title. the results on semigroups can be easily transferred to hyper-semigroups in the way indicated in the present . 
  this  is a commentary and a reading guide to three s by herbert busemann, \"uber die geometrien, in denen die "kreise mit unendlichem radius" die k\"urzesten linien sind." (on the geometries where circles of infinite radius are the shortest lines) (1932), "paschsches axiom und zweidimensionalit\"at," (pasch's axiom and two--dimensionality) (1933) and "\"uber r\"aume mit konvexen kugeln und parallelenaxiom (on spaces with convex spheres and the parallel postulate) (1933). these are the first s that busemann wrote on the foundations of geometry and the axiomatic characterization of minkowski spaces (finite-dimensional normed spaces). the subject of these s followed busemann for the rest of his life, and the three s already contain several ideas and techniques that he developed later on, in his work on the subject which lasted several decades. the three s were translated into english by annette a'campo. these translations, together with the final version of present commentary, will be part of the forthcoming edition of busemann's collected s edition. 
  due to the availability of references of research s and the rich information contained in s, various citation analysis approaches have been proposed to identify similar documents for scholar recommendation. despite of the success of previous approaches, they are, however, based on co-occurrence of items. once there are no co-occurrence items available in documents, they will not work well. inspired by distributed representations of words in the literature of natural language processing, we propose a novel approach to measuring the similarity of s based on distributed representations learned from the citation context of s. we view the set of s as the vocabulary, define the weighted citation context of s, and convert it to weight matrix similar to the word-word cooccurrence matrix in natural language processing. after that we explore a variant of matrix factorization approach to train distributed representations of s on the matrix, and leverage the distributed representations to measure similarities of s. in the experiment, we exhibit that our approach outperforms state-of-theart citation-based approaches by 25%, and better than other distributed representation based methods. 
  evergreens in science are s that display a continual rise in annual citations without decline, at least within a sufficiently long time period. aiming to better understand evergreens in particular and patterns of citation trajectory in general, this  develops a functional data analysis method to cluster citation trajectories of a sample of 1699 research s published in 1980 in the american physical society (aps) journals. we propose a functional poisson regression model for individual s' citation trajectories, and fit the model to the observed 30-year citations of individual s by functional principal component analysis and maximum likelihood estimation. based on the estimated -specific coefficients, we apply the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster s into different groups, for uncovering general types of citation trajectories. the result demonstrates the existence of an evergreen cluster of s that do not exhibit any decline in annual citations over 30 years. 
  this document contains comments on some of my s. 
  the realization of optoelectronic devices on  has been an outstanding challenge due to the large surface roughness and incompatible nature of  with optical materials. here, we demonstrate a new class of optoelectronic devices on a piece of printing  using graphene as an electrically reconfigurable optical medium. our approach relies on electro-modulation of optical properties of multilayer graphene on  via blocking the interband electronic transitions. the  based devices yield high optical contrast in the visible spectrum with fast response speed. pattering graphene into multiple pixels, folding  into 3-dimensional shapes or printing coloured ink on  substrates enable us to demonstrate novel optoelectronic devices which cannot be realized with wafer-based techniques. 
  in this  we correct the errors of yu.~n.~kuznetsova's  on the continuous duality for moore groups. 
  this  provides a rewording in the language of lax-functors of the definition of open dynamics given in our systemic theory of interactivity exposed in previous s. 
  this  is the continuation of the previous two s with the same title. 
  this  defines and explores the direct citations between citing publications (dccps) of a publication. we construct an ego-centered citation network for each  that contains all of its citing s and itself, as well as the citation relationships among them. by utilizing a large-scale scholarly dataset from the computer science field in the microsoft academic graph (mag-cs) dataset, we find that dccps exist universally in medium- and high-impact s. for those s that have dccps, dccps do occur frequently; higher-impact s tend to contain more dccps than others. meanwhile, the number of dccps of s published in different years does not vary dramatically. the current  also discusses the relationship between dccps and some indirect citation relationships (e.g., co-citation and bibliographic coupling). 
  modification of calcium carbonate particles with surfactant significantly improves the properties of the calcium carbonate coating on . unmodified and ctab and oleate-modified calcium carbonate nanoparticles were prepared using the wet carbonation technique for  coating. ctab (cationic surfactant) and sodium oleate (anionic surfactant) were used to modify the size, morphology, and surface properties of the precipitated nanoparticles. the obtained particles were characterized by xrd, ft-ir spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, tga and tem. coating colors were formulated from the prepared unmodified and modified calcium carbonates and examined by creating a thin coating layer on reference . the effect of calcium carbonate particle size and surface modification on  properties, such as coating thickness, coating weight, surface roughness, air permeability, brightness, whiteness, opacity, and hydrophobicity, were investigated and compared with gcc calcium carbonate-coated s. the obtained calcium carbonate nanoparticles are in the calcite phase. the morphology of the prepared calcium carbonate nanoparticles is rhombohedral, and the average particle diameter is &lt;100 nm. compared to commercial gcc, the use of unmodified and ctab- and oleate-modified calcium carbonate nanoparticles in  coating improves the properties of . the highest measured  properties were observed for  coated with oleate-modifed nanoparticles, where an increase in smoothness (decrease in  roughness) (+23%), brightness (+1.3%), whiteness (+2.8%), and opacity (+2.3%) and a decrease in air permeability (-26%) was obtained with 25% less coat weight. the wca at 10 min was about 112{\deg} for the  coated with oleate-modified nanoparticles and 42{\deg} for  coated with ctab-modified nanoparticles compared to 104{\deg} for gcc-coated . 
  spanish astronomy has grown rapidly during the 1990s. the number of s published per year has doubled, to about 4% of the world total. the number of high-impact s, however, remains constant at about 1% of the world total. s from france, germany and italy also have lower impact than their numbers suggest, while for the us, uk, japan, netherlands and australia, the fraction of high-impact s is approximately the same as the fraction of all s. we suggest a few possible explanations for this difference. 
  in this , the existence and uniqueness of foliations by constant mean curvature spheres on asymptotically flat manifolds of nonzero adm mass in all dimensions were established. (a similar result in the case of positive mass was obtained independently by g. huisken and s. t. yau, see the introduction of this  and their  in inv. math.) 
  the contents of this 6-page  have been subsumed into the 13-page , "a note on closed 3-braids", arxiv:0802.1072 [math.gt]. this  is correct, but contains less information than the new one. the topological classification of knots that are closed braids is shown to lead to a classification theorem for transversal knots that are closed 3-braids. a list is given of all low crossing examples of transversally non-simple knots that are closed 3-braids. 
  einstein's goal of producing an advanced gravitational model that was independent of special relativity's "non-gravitational" derivations has arguably still not been achieved. the author produced a  in 1998 outlining a possible method of attack on the problem based on shift equivalence principles ("doppler mass shift"). some problems with this  have since come to light. we list some further developments, some s not cited in gr-qc9807084, some experimental results missed by the author, and identify a problem with the 's approach to aberration effects. 
  this is simply a long list of s that i have found useful. they are generally related to aspects of the search for evidence that the sun influences the climate somehow. there are s on data, on methods and s that just discuss the problems. so far the list is not structured, but it is planned that later versions will have lists that are sorted into general subject classes. 
  this work presents a model that allows the study of research specialties through the manifestations of the specialty's social and epistemological processes in a collection of journal s. collections of s are modeled as coupled bipartite networks interlinking 7 types of entities. matrix-based link weight functions are introduced to calculate weighted bipartite networks and weighted unipartite co-occurrence networks in the collection of s. these weight calculation methods, when used in conjunction with unweighted bipartite growth models, produce simple growth models for weighted networks in collections of s. 
  the normal  used in any printer is among the cheapest flexible organic materials that exist. we demonstrate that we can print on  high-frequency circuits tunable with an applied dc voltage. this is possible with the help of an ink containing functionalized carbon nanotubes and water. after the water is evaporated from the , the nanotubes remain steadily imprinted on , showing a semiconducting behaviour and tunable electrical properties. 
  this  has been withdrawn, not because of any errors (that we know of), but because rather than presenting our material as a series of 3 s, as we originally intended, we have now combined them into one long , which is "a theory of generalized donaldson-thomas invariants", arxiv:0810.5645v3, june 2009, 181 pages, and this  has been incorporated into that. 
  we review a new form of entropy suggested by us, with origin in mixing of states of systems due to interactions and deformations of phase cells. it is demonstrated that this nonextensive form also leads to asymmetric maximal entropy configurations unlike shannon entropy. we discuss how, beginning with quantum entanglement of microsystems with one another and with the environment, one can obtain classical stochasticity for our form of entropy. 
  in this  a result of latala about the tail behavior of gaussian polynomials will be discussed. latala proved an interesting result about this problem in  [2]. but his proof applied an incorrect statement at a crucial point. hence the question may arise whether the main result of  [2] is valid. the goal of this  is to settle this problem by presenting such a proof where the application of the erroneous statement is avoided. i discuss the proofs in detail even at the price of a longer text and try to give such an explanation that reveals the ideas behind them better than the original . \ 
   is withdrawn. on review the  contributes little of significance. the runtime analysis of the algorithms presented, while correct in terms of number of operations, does not represent the complexity of the algorithms in terms of "bits input". a naive mistake in reasoning. 
  this  is a reply to the article "scopus's source normalized impact per  (snip) versus a journal impact factor based on fractional counting of citations", published by loet leydesdorff and tobias opthof (arxiv:1004.3580v2 [cs.dl]). it clarifies the relationship between snip and elsevier's scopus. since leydesdorff and opthof's description of snip is not complete, it indicates four key differences between snip and the indicator proposed by the two authors, and argues why the former is more valid than the latter. nevertheless, the idea of fractional citation counting deserves further exploration. the  discusses difficulties that arise if one attempts to apply this principle at the level of individual (citing) s. 
  this  is now part of the new  "series with hermite polynomials and applications" arxiv:1710.00687. 
  the aim of this  is to present some properties of choquet maximal radon probability measures on compact, convex subsets of hausdorff, locally convex, topological real vector spaces. theorem 3.12 is the main result of the . while somewhat technical, the results here are foundational for my proof of a stone-weierstrass theorem for non-separable c*-algebras, in the companion  'on the stone-weierstrass theorem'. 
  i discuss albert einstein's 1916 general theory of relativity. i show that in einstein's 1916 review , "the foundation of the general theory of relativity", he derived his november 25, 1915 field equations with an additional term on the right hand side involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor (he posed the condition square root -g=1) using the equations he presented on november 4, 1915. series of s: final . 
  this is a sequel to my  "the octagonal pet i: renormalization and hyperbolic symmetry". in this  we use the renormalization scheme found in the first  to classify the limit sets of the systems according to their topology. the main result is that the limit set is either a finite forest or a cantor set, with an explicit description of which cases occur for which parameters. in one special case, the limit set is a disjoint union of 2 arcs if and only if the continued fraction expansion of the parameter has the form [a0:a1:a2:a3...] with a_k even for every odd k. 
  in this , we systematically apply grothendieck duality theorem to simplify the proofs of several theorems in different s: including a vanishing theorem in kmm, a theorem of koll\'{a}r's , a vanishing theorem due to kov\'{a}cs and a theorem of fujino. we remark that all of the above are achieved by the same trick. 
  we demonstrate a comprehensive framework that accounts for citation dynamics of scientific s and for the age distribution of references. we show that citation dynamics of scientific s is nonlinear and this nonlinearity has far-reaching consequences, such as diverging citation distributions and runaway s. we propose a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model of citation dynamics based on link copyingredirection mechanism. the model is fully calibrated by empirical data and does not contain free parameters. this model can be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics of individual s and of the journal impact factor. 
  astro-h white s are meant to provide useful information to scientists who plan observations from the satellite. this short  introduces the 16 astro-h white s in addition to general description of the satellite and its new features. 
  this is a typeset version of alan turing's declassified second world war  \textit{ on statistics of repetitions}. see the companion , \textit{the applications of probability to cryptography}, also available from arxiv at arxiv:1505.04714, for editor's notes. 
  the classification of abelian groups of central type is well known. however, the description of non-abelian groups of central type which are known to be solvable, is far from being understood. in this  we classify all groups of central type of order p^4 where p is a prime number. 
  we present here evidence for the existence of a citation advantage within astrophysics for s that link to data. using simple measures based on publication data from nasa astrophysics data system we find a citation advantage for s with links to data receiving on the average significantly more citations per  than s without links to data. furthermore, using inspec and web of science databases we investigate whether either s of an experimental or theoretical nature display different citation behavior. 
  this  is a continuation of the  [16]. namely, in [16] we have introduced, among others, the definition of the atomic entailment and we have constructed the system \overset\sqcap s, which is based on the atomic entailment. in this  we show that the classical arithmetic can be based on the atomic logic (see [17]). 
  this  starts with a biographical sketch of the life of josef meixner. then his motivations to work on orthogonal polynomials and special functions are reviewed. meixner's 1934  introducing the meixner and meixner-pollaczek polynomials is discussed in detail. truksa's forgotten 1931 , which already contains the meixner polynomials, is mentioned. the  ends with a survey of the reception of meixner's 1934 . 
  we give a detailed proof for gordan-noether's results in "ueber die algebraischen formen, deren hesse'sche determinante identisch verschwindet." c. lossen has written a  in a similar direction as the present . however, our  is independent of lossen's  and includes a considerable number of new observations 
  this  analyzes the structure of mixed-strategy equilibria for colonel blotto games, where the outcome on each battlefield is a polynomial function of the difference between the two players' allocations. this  severely reduces the set of strategies that needs to be searched to find a nash equilibrium. it finds that there exists a nash equilibrium where both players' mixed strategies are discrete distributions, and it places an upper bound on the number of points in the supports of these discrete distributions. 
  in the introduction of this  we discuss a possible approach to the unitarizability problem for classical p-adic groups. in this  we give some very limited support that such approach is not without chance. in a forthcoming  we shall give additional evidence in generalized cuspidal rank (up to) three. 
  in this , we prove the mohebi-radjabalipour conjecture under a little additional condition, and obtain a new invariant subspace theorem for subdecomposable operators. our main result contains as special cases the main results of mohebi-radjabalipour's  published in integr. equ. oper. theory 18 (1990) as well as liu's  and liu-lin's  published in science in china 46 (2003) and illinois j. math. 47 (2003) respectively. in particular, we give some explicit examples to illustrate that the condition in our theorem is really much weaker than that in the three s described above. 
  we develop a model for the distribution of scientific citations. the model involves a dual mechanism: in the direct mechanism, the author of a new  finds an old  a and cites it. in the indirect mechanism, the author of a new  finds an old  a only via the reference list of a newer intermediary  b, which has previously cited a. by comparison to citation databases, we find that s having few citations are cited mainly by the direct mechanism. s already having many citations ('classics') are cited mainly by the indirect mechanism. the indirect mechanism gives a power-law tail. the 'tipping point' at which a  becomes a classic is about 21 citations for s published in the institute for scientific information (isi) web of science database in 1981, 29 for physical review d s published from 1975-1994, and 39 for all publications from a list of high h-index chemists assembled in 2007. the power-law exponent is not universal. individuals who are highly cited have a systematically smaller exponent than individuals who are less cited. 
  historically, s have been physically bound to the journal in which they were published but in the electronic age s are available individually, no longer tied to their respective journals. hence, s now can be read and cited based on their own merits, independently of the journal's physical availability, reputation, or impact factor. we compare the strength of the relationship between journals' impact factors and the actual citations received by their respective s from 1902 to 2009. throughout most of the 20th century, s' citation rates were increasingly linked to their respective journals' impact factors. however, since 1990, the advent of the digital age, the strength of the relation between impact factors and  citations has been decreasing. this decrease began sooner in physics, a field that was quicker to make the transition into the electronic domain. furthermore, since 1990, the proportion of highly cited s coming from highly cited journals has been decreasing, and accordingly, the proportion of highly cited s not coming from highly cited journals has also been increasing. should this pattern continue, it might bring an end to the use of the impact factor as a way to evaluate the quality of journals, s and researchers. 
  we have used data from ads, aas, and astro-ph, to study the publishing, preprint posting, and citation patterns for s published in the apj in 1999 and 2002. this allowed us to track statistical trends in author demographics, preprint posting habits, and citation rates for apj s as a whole and across various subgroups and types of apj s. the most interesting results are the frequencies of use of the astro-ph server across various subdisciplines of astronomy, and the impact that such posting has on the citation history of the subsequent apj s. by 2002 72% of apj s were posted as astro-ph preprints, but this fraction varies from 22-95% among the subfields studied. a majority of these preprints (61%) were posted after the s were accepted at apj, and 88% were posted or updated after acceptance. on average, apj s posted on astro-ph are cited more than twice as often as those that are not posted on astro-ph. this difference can account for a number of other, secondary citation trends, including some of the differences in citation rates between journals and different subdisciplines. preprints clearly have supplanted the journals as the primary means for initially becoming aware of s, at least for a large fraction of the apj author community. publication in a widely-recognized peer-reviewed journal remains as the primary determinant of the impact of a , however. for example, conference proceedings s posted on astro-ph are also cited twice as frequently as those that are not posted, but overall such s are still cited 20 times less often than the average apj . these results provide insights into how astronomical research is currently disseminated by authors and ingested by readers. 
  we describe an implementation of a semi-automated review system for the astrophysics literature. registered users identify names under which they publish, and provide scores for individual s of their choosing. scores are held confidentially, and combined in a weighted average grade for each . the grade is divided among the co-authors as assigned credit. the credit accumulated by each user (their ``mass'') provides the weight by which their score is averaged into s' grades. thus, s' grades and users' masses are mutually dependent and evolve in time as scores are added. likewise, a user's influence on the grade of a  is determined from the perceived original scientific contribution of all the user's previous s. the implementation, called refsponse -- currently hosted at http:bororo.physics.mcgill.ca -- includes s in astro-ph, the apj, aj, a&amp;a, mnras, pasp, pasj, new astronomy, nature, ara&amp;a, phys. rev. letters, phys. rev. d. and acta astronomica from 1965 to the present, making extensive use of the nasaads abstract server. we describe some of the possible utilities of this system in enabling progress in the field. 
  numerical data for the distribution of citations are examined for: (i) s published in 1981 in journals which are catalogued by the institute for scientific information (783,339 s) and (ii) 20 years of publications in physical review d, vols. 11-50 (24,296 s). a zipf plot of the number of citations to a given  versus its citation rank appears to be consistent with a power-law dependence for leading rank s, with exponent close to -12. this, in turn, suggests that the number of s with x citations, n(x), has a large-x power law decay n(x)~x^{-alpha}, with alpha approximately equal to 3. 
  this  presents a novel model for author- networks, which is based on the assumption that authors are organized into groups and that, for each research topic, the number of s published by a group is based on a success-breeds-success model. collaboration between groups is modeled as random invitations from a group to an outside member. to analyze the model, a number of different metrics that can be obtained in author- networks were extracted. a simulation example shows that this model can effectively mimic the behavior of a real-world author- network, extracted from a collection of 900 journal s in the field of complex networks. 
  collections of journal s, often referred to as 'citation networks', can be modeled as a collection of coupled bipartite networks which tend to exhibit linear growth and preferential attachment as s are added to the collection. assuming primary nodes in the first partition and secondary nodes in the second partition, the basic bipartite yule process assumes that as each primary node is added to the network, it links to multiple secondary nodes, and with probability, \alpha, each new link may connect to a newly appearing secondary node. the number of links from a new primary node follows some distribution that is a characteristic of the specific network. links to existing secondary nodes follow a preferential attachment rule. with modifications to adapt to specific networks, bipartite yule processes simulate networks that can be validated against actual networks using a wide variety of network metrics. the application of bipartite yule processes to the simulation of -reference networks and -author networks is demonstrated and simulation results are shown to mimic networks from actual collections of s across several network metrics. 
  this  is second in a series of three s; the first of which is "summation formulas, from poisson and voronoi to the present" (math.nt0304187), and the third of which is "automorphic distributions, l-functions, and voronoi summation for gl(3)". the first  is primarily an expository , while the third proves a voronoi-style summation formula for the coefficients of a cusp form on gl(3,z)\gl(3,r). this present  contains the distributional machinery used in the third  for rigorously deriving the summation formula, and also for the proof of the gl(3)xgl(1) converse theorem given in the third . the primary concept studied is a notion of the order of vanishing of a distribution along a closed submanifold. applications are given to the analytic continuation of riemann's zeta function; degree 1 and degree 2 l-functions; the converse theorem for gl(2); and a characterization of the classical mellin transforminversion relations on functions with specified singularities. 
  this  is the second  in a series of four s that introduce cybersusy, which is a new method for analyzing supersymmetry breaking in the standard supersymmetric model (ssm). the first  was a summary of the results and the three next s set out the details. in this second , we derive the full brs operator and action for the general massless wess-zumino chiral supersymmetry action. this includes the source terms which bring in the equations of motion. the auxiliary field is integrated, which removes manifest supersymmetry, but which allows the legendre transform to operate correctly to define one-particle-irreducible vertices from the connected green's functions. then some special terms in the brs cohomology are described, together with the constraint equations that they must satisfy. these `simple dotspinors' are generated by a `fundamental dotspinor', which is constructed partly from the zinn sources. the equations of motion play a very important role in the cohomology for this theory. these dotspinors play an interesting role in the brs cohomology of the standard model, which is the subject of the third  in the series. 
  the  cern-ph-ep-2009-015 (arxiv:0903.4762) by a. bagulya et al. violates standards of quality of work and scientific ethics on several counts. the  contains assertions that contradict established detector physics. the  falls short of proving the correctness of the authors' concepts and results. the  ignores or quotes misleadingly pertinent published work. the  ignores the fact that the authors' concepts and results have already been shown wrong in the published literature. the authors seem unaware that cross-section results from the 'harp collaboration' that are based on the 's concepts and algorithms are in gross disagreement with the results of a second analysis of the same data, and with the results of other experiments. 
  the first part of this  completes the classification of whitney towers in the 4-ball that was started in three related s. we provide an algebraic framework allowing the computations of the graded groups associated to geometric filtrations of classical link concordance by order n (twisted) whitney towers in the 4-ball. higher-order sato-levine invariants and higher-order arf invariants are defined and shown to be the obstructions to framing a twisted whitney tower. in the second part of this , a general theory of quadratic forms is developed and then specialized from the non-commutative to the commutative to finally, the symmetric settings. the intersection invariant for twisted whitney towers is shown to be the universal symmetric refinement of the framed intersection invariant. update: the results of the first six sections of this  have been subsumed into the  "whitney tower concordance of classical links." 
  the methods presented in this  allow for a statistical analysis revealing centers of excellence around the world using programs that are freely available. based on web of science data, field-specific excellence can be identified in cities where highly-cited s were published significantly. compared to the mapping approaches published hitherto, our approach is more analytically oriented by allowing the assessment of an observed number of excellent s for a city (in the sample) against the expected number. using this test, the approach cannot only identify the top performers in output but the "true jewels." these are cities locating authors who publish significantly more top cited s than can be expected. as the examples in this  show for physics, chemistry, and psychology, these cities do not necessarily have a high output of excellent s. 
  this  proposes an architecture and assignment management model of a conference management system that performs a precise and accurate automatic assignment of reviewers to s. the system relies on taxonomy of keywords to describe s and reviewers' competences. the implied hierarchical structure of the taxonomy provides important additional information - the semantic relationships between the separate keywords. it allows similarity measures to take into account not only the number of exactly matching keywords between a  and a reviewer, but in case of non-matching ones to calculate how semantically close they are. reviewers are allowed to bid on the s they would like to (or not like to) review and to explicitly state conflicts of interest (coi) with s. an automatic coi detection is checking for additional conflicts based on institutional affiliation, co-authorship (within the local database) and previous co-authorship in the past (within the major bibliographic indexes and digital libraries). the algorithm for automatic assignment takes into account all - selected keywords, reviewers' bids and conflicts of interest and tries to find the most accurate assignment while maintaining load balancing among reviewers. 
  a huge number of academic s are coming out from a lot of conferences and journals these days. in these circumstances, most researchers rely on key-based search or browsing through proceedings of top conferences and journals to find their related work. to ease this difficulty, we propose a personalized academic research  recommendation system, which recommends related articles, for each researcher, that may be interesting to herhim. in this , we first introduce our web crawler to retrieve research s from the web. then, we define similarity between two research s based on the text similarity between them. finally, we propose our recommender system developed using collaborative filtering methods. our evaluation results demonstrate that our system recommends good quality research s. 
  this is the second  in a series of three s. in the first  of the series, "artinian gorenstein algebras with linear resolutions", (arxiv:1306.2523, j. of algebra, to appear) we prove that it is possible to give the minimal resolution of the rings from the title in terms of the coefficients of the corresponding macaulay inverse system. in this context, the word "give" means, "give in a polynomial manner". the first  in the series proves, essentially, an existence theorem. the second and third s in the series construct the explicit formulas for the resolution. the present  is concerned with artinian gorenstein algebras of embedding codimension three. in the third , "the structure of gorenstein-linear resolutions of artinian algebras", the embedding codimension is arbitrary. 
  in the sigmod 2013 conference, we published a  extending our earlier work on crowdsourced entity resolution to improve crowdsourced join processing by exploiting transitive relationships [wang et al. 2013]. the vldb 2014 conference has a  that follows up on our previous work [vesdapunt et al., 2014], which points out and corrects a mistake we made in our sigmod . specifically, in section 4.2 of our sigmod , we defined the "expected optimal labeling order" (eolo) problem, and proposed an algorithm for solving it. we incorrectly claimed that our algorithm is optimal. in their , vesdapunt et al. show that the problem is actually np-hard, and based on that observation, propose a new algorithm to solve it. in this note, we would like to put the vesdapunt et al. results in context, something we believe that their  does not adequately do. 
  this  is the third in a series which explores a combinatorial method for generating lattice polygons in the plane. i call this method the plaid model.   in this  i prove the main result i had been aiming for since the beginning, which is to show that there is a coarse isomorphism between the plaid model and the so-called arithmetic graph for outer billiards on kites. the content of the theorem is that the plaid model predicts the symbolic dynamics of the outer billiards orbits, up to an error of one unit. this result combines with the work in the other s to give a second proof that outer billiards has unbounded orbits for every irrational kite. so far, these are the only known polygonal examples with this property. 
  we consider the p\'olya random walk in \mathbb{z}^d. we assume that it starts from the origin and after some excursion returns to the original point again. given this condition, the  establishes a number of results for the conditional probability distributions and expectations of the number of usual (undirected) and specifically defined in the  up- and down-directed state-crossings and different sets of states crossings. one of the most important results of this  is that for the p\'olya random walk, the conditional expectation of the number of state-crossings is equal to 1 for any state \mathbf{n}\in\mathbb{z}^d\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}. 
  to quantify the mechanism of a complex network growth we focus on the network of citations of scientific s and use a combination of the theoretical and experimental tools to uncover microscopic details of this network growth. namely, we develop a stochastic model of citation dynamics based on copyingredirectiontriadic closure mechanism. in a complementary and coherent way, the model accounts both for statistics of references of scientific s and for their citation dynamics. originating in empirical measurements, the model is cast in such a way that it can be verified quantitatively in every aspect. such verification is performed by measuring citation dynamics of physics s. the measurements revealed nonlinear citation dynamics, the nonlinearity being intricately related to network topology. the nonlinearity has far-reaching consequences including non-stationary citation distributions, diverging citation trajectory of similar s, runaways or "immortal s" with infinite citation lifetime etc. thus, our most important finding is nonlinearity in complex network growth. in a more specific context, our results can be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics of individual s and of the journal impact factor. 
  this is the first of two s where we relate tangent cones of hermitian-yang-mills connections at an isolated singularity to the complex algebraic geometry of the underlying reflexive sheaf, when the sheaf is locally modelled on the pull-back of a holomorphic vector bundle from the projective space. in this  we shall impose an extra assumption that the graded sheaf determined by the harder-narasimhan-seshadri filtration of the vector bundle is reflexive. in general we conjecture that the tangent cone is uniquely determined by the harder-narasimhan-seshadri filtration of an algebraic tangent cone, which is a certain torsion-free sheaf on the projective space. in this  we also prove this conjecture when there is an algebraic tangent cone which is locally free and stable. 
  several authors have proposed that a large number of unusual combinations of cited references in a  point to its high creative potential (or novelty). however, it is still not clear whether the number of unusual combinations can really measure the creative potential of s. the current study addresses this question on the basis of several case studies from the field of scientometrics. we identified some landmark s in this field. study subjects were the corresponding authors of these s. we asked them where the ideas for the s came from and which role the cited publications played. the results revealed that the creative ideas might not necessarily have been inspired by past publications. the literature seems to be important for the contextualization of the idea in the field of scientometrics. instead, we found that creative ideas are the result of finding solutions to practical problems, result from discussions with colleagues, and profit from interdisciplinary exchange. the roots of the studied landmark s are discussed in detail. 
  there has been a long history of research into the structure and evolution of mankind's scientific endeavor. however, recent progress in applying the tools of science to understand science itself has been unprecedented because only recently has there been access to high-volume and high-quality data sets of scientific output (e.g., publications, patents, grants), as well as computers and algorithms capable of handling this enormous stream of data. this  reviews major work on models that aim to capture and recreate the structure and dynamics of scientific evolution. we then introduce a general process model that simultaneously grows co-author and -citation networks. the statistical and dynamic properties of the networks generated by this model are validated against a 20-year data set of articles published in the proceedings of the national academy of science. systematic deviations from a power law distribution of citations to s are well fit by a model that incorporates a partitioning of authors and s into topics, a bias for authors to cite recent s, and a tendency for authors to cite s cited by s that they have read. in this tarl model (for topics, aging, and recursive linking), the number of topics is linearly related to the clustering coefficient of the simulated  citation network. 
  in early eighties, belavin and drinfeld showed that nonskewsymmetric classical r-matrices for simple lie algebras are classified by combinatorial objects which are now called belavin-drinfeld triples. later the second author of the present  generalized this result to the case of dynamical r-matrices, and showed that they correspond to generalized belavin-drinfeld triples. the dynamical r-matrix corresponding a triple is given by a certain explicit formula, which works for any symmetrizable kac-moody algebra. in special cases, this formula gives the felder and the belavin r-matrix.   in 1994, felder associated with every dynamical r-matrix a system of differential equations called the kzb equations. in the case of the felder and belavin r-matrix, solutions of these equations are known to have a representation theoretical presentation, as conformal blocks (i.e. traces of products of intertwining operators between representations of lie algebras).   in this , we propose such a presentation for any dynamical r-matrix given by the second author's formula. in particular, the  sheds light on the belavin-drinfeld classical r-matrices of 1984.   this  begins a series of s. in the next , joint with t.schedler, we will give an explicit quantization of the dynamical r-matrices for simple lie algebras (in particular, belavin-drinfeld r-matrices), which has been an open problem for a number of years. in another , we plan to generalize the results of the present  to quantum groups. this should yield quantum kzb equations which involve quantum r-matrices obtained by quantizing the classical r-matrices that appear in this . 
  conference  assignment, i.e., the task of assigning  submissions to reviewers, presents multi-faceted issues for recommender systems research. besides the traditional goal of predicting `who likes what?', a conference management system must take into account aspects such as: reviewer capacity constraints, adequate numbers of reviews for s, expertise modeling, conflicts of interest, and an overall distribution of assignments that balances reviewer preferences with conference objectives. among these, issues of modeling preferences and tastes in reviewing have traditionally been studied separately from the optimization of -reviewer assignment. in this , we present an integrated study of both these aspects. first, due to the paucity of data per reviewer or per  (relative to other recommender systems applications) we show how we can integrate multiple sources of information to learn -reviewer preference models. second, our models are evaluated not just in terms of prediction accuracy but in terms of the end-assignment quality. using a linear programming-based assignment optimization formulation, we show how our approach better explores the space of unsupplied assignments to maximize the overall affinities of s assigned to reviewers. we demonstrate our results on real reviewer preference data from the ieee icdm 2007 conference. 
  this  further develops work from a previous article which introduced a new way of modelling evolutionary game models with an emphasis on ecological realism, concerned with how ecological factors determine payoffs in evolutionary games. the current  is focused on the impact of selectively neutral factors (i.e. those that are the same for all strategies), such as background fitness and a neutral density dependence on game dynamics. in the previous  background mortality was modelled by post-reproductive mortality describing aggregated mortality between game interactions. in this  a novel approach to the modelling of background fitness, based on different occurrence rates (intensities) of game interactions and background events is presented. it is shown that the new method is more realistic and natural for dynamic models than the method used in the previous . the previous method in effect produces biased trajectories, but it is compatible with the new approach at the restpoints. also in this  a rigorous stability analysis of the restpoints of the dynamics is presented. it is shown that the stability or instability of the restpoints, can be explained by a mechanism of eco-evolutionary feedback. the results obtained are illustrated by a hawk-dove game example. 
  evaluating the performance of researchers and measuring the impact of s written by scientists is the main objective of citation analysis. various indices and metrics have been proposed for this. in this , we propose a new citation index citex, which gives normalized scores to authors and s to determine their rankings. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first citation index which simultaneously assigns scores to both authors and s. using these scores, we can get an objective measure of the reputation of an author and the impact of a .   we model this problem as an iterative computation on a publication graph, whose vertices are authors and s, and whose edges indicate which author has written which . we prove that this iterative computation converges in the limit, by using a powerful theorem from linear algebra. we run this algorithm on several examples, and find that the author and  scores match closely with what is suggested by our intuition. the algorithm is theoretically sound and runs very fast in practice. we compare this index with several existing metrics and find that citex gives far more accurate scores compared to the traditional metrics. 
  recent years have witnessed the increase of competition in science. while promoting the quality of research in many cases, an intense competition among scientists can also trigger unethical scientific behaviors. to increase the total number of published s, some authors even resort to software tools that are able to produce grammatical, but meaningless scientific manuscripts. because automatically generated s can be misunderstood as real s, it becomes of paramount importance to develop means to identify these scientific frauds. in this , i devise a methodology to distinguish real manuscripts from those generated with scigen, an automatic  generator. upon modeling texts as complex networks (cn), it was possible to discriminate real from fake s with at least 89\% of accuracy. a systematic analysis of features relevance revealed that the accessibility and betweenness were useful in particular cases, even though the relevance depended upon the dataset. the successful application of the methods described here show, as a proof of principle, that network features can be used to identify scientific gibberish s. in addition, the cn-based approach can be combined in a straightforward fashion with traditional statistical language processing methods to improve the performance in identifying artificially generated s. 
  due to the fact that the numbers of annually published s have witnessed a linear growth in some citation networks, a geometric model is thus proposed to predict some statistical features of those networks, in which the academic influence scopes of the s are denoted through specific geometric areas related to time and space. in the model, nodes (s) are uniformly and randomly sprinkled onto a cluster of circles of the minkowski space whose centers are on the time axis. edges (citations) are linked according to an influence mechanism which indicates that an existing  will be cited by a new  located in its influence zone. considering the citations among s in different disciplines, an interdisciplinary citation mechanism is added to the model in which some s with a small probability of being chosen will cite some existing s randomly and uniformly. different from most existing models that only study the power-law tail of the in-degree distribution, this model also characterizes the overall in-degree distribution. moreover, it presents the description of some other important statistical characteristics of real networks, such as in- and out-assortativity, giant component and clear community structure. therefore, it is reasonable to believe that a good example is provided in the  to study real networks by geometric graphs. 
  in this  we study the implications for conference program committees of using single-blind reviewing, in which committee members are aware of the names and affiliations of  authors, versus double-blind reviewing, in which this information is not visible to committee members. wsdm 2017, the 10th acm international acm conference on web search and data mining, performed a controlled experiment in which each  was reviewed by four committee members. two of these four reviewers were chosen from a pool of committee members who had access to author information; the other two were chosen from a disjoint pool who did not have access to this information. this information asymmetry persisted through the process of bidding for s, reviewing s, and entering scores. reviewers in the single-blind condition typically bid for 22% fewer s, and preferentially bid for s from top institutions. once s were allocated to reviewers, single-blind reviewers were significantly more likely than their double-blind counterparts to recommend for acceptance s from famous authors and top institutions. the estimated odds multipliers are 1.63 for famous authors and 1.58 and 2.10 for top universities and companies respectively, so the result is tangible. for female authors, the associated odds multiplier of 0.78 is not statistically significant in our study. however, a meta-analysis places this value in line with that of other experiments, and in the context of this larger aggregate the gender effect is also statistically significant. 
  in this , we propose a novel  fingerprinting technique based on analyzing the translucent patterns revealed when a light source shines through the . these patterns represent the inherent texture of , formed by the random interleaving of wooden particles during the manufacturing process. we show these patterns can be easily captured by a commodity camera and condensed into to a compact 2048-bit fingerprint code. prominent works in this area (nature 2005, ieee s&amp;p 2009, ccs 2011) have all focused on fingerprinting  based on the  "surface". we are motivated by the observation that capturing the surface alone misses important distinctive features such as the non-even thickness, the random distribution of impurities, and different materials in the  with varying opacities. through experiments, we demonstrate that the embedded  texture provides a more reliable source for fingerprinting than features on the surface. based on the collected datasets, we achieve 0% false rejection and 0% false acceptance rates. we further  that our extracted fingerprints contain 807 degrees-of-freedom (dof), which is much higher than the 249 dof with iris codes (that have the same size of 2048 bits). the high amount of dof for texture-based fingerprints makes our method extremely scalable for recognition among very large databases; it also allows secure usage of the extracted fingerprint in privacy-preserving authentication schemes based on error correction techniques. 
  academic literature retrieval is concerned with the selection of s that are most likely to match a user's information needs. most of the retrieval systems are limited to list-output models, in which the retrieval results are isolated from each other. in this work, we aim to uncover the relationships of the retrieval results and propose a method for building structural retrieval results for academic literatures, which we call a  evolution graph (peg). a peg describes the evolution of the diverse aspects of input queries through several evolution chains of s. by utilizing the author, citation and content information, pegs can uncover the various underlying relationships among the s and present the evolution of articles from multiple viewpoints. our system supports three types of input queries: keyword, single- and two- queries. the construction of a peg mainly consists of three steps. first, the s are soft-clustered into communities via metagraph factorization during which the topic distribution of each  is obtained. second, topically cohesive evolution chains are extracted from the communities that are relevant to the query. each chain focuses on one aspect of the query. finally, the extracted chains are combined to generate a peg, which fully covers all the topics of the query. the experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is able to construct meaningful pegs. 
  this short  aims to investigate some of the historical developments of one classic, well-cited and highly esteemed scientific journal in the domain of quantitative operations research - namely the informs journal operations research - over a period of 25 years between 1981 and 2006. as such this , and the journal in question, represents one representative attempt to analyze - for the purpose of possible future generalization - how research production has evolved, and evolves, over time. among the general developments that we think we can trace are that (a) the historical overviews (i.e., literature surveys) in the articles, as well as the list of references, somewhat counter-intuitively shrink over time, while (b) the motivating and modelling parts grow. we also attempt to characterize - in some detail - the appearance and character, over time, of the most cited, as well as the least cited, s over the years studied. in particular, we find that many of the least cited s are quite imbalanced. for example, some of them include one main section only, and the least cited s also have shorter reference lists.   we also analyse the articles' utilization of important buzz words representing the constitutive parts of an or journal , based on subben's checklist (larsson and patriksson, 2014, 2016). based on a word count of these buzz words we conclude through a citation study, utilizing a collection of particularly highly or little cited s, that there is a quite strong positive correlation between a journal  being highly cited and its degree of utilization of this checklist. 
  this volume contains the proceedings of the 1st international workshop on methods and tools for rigorous system design (metrid 2018), held on the 15th of april, 2018 in thessaloniki, greece as part of etaps 2018, the european joint conferences on theory and practice of software.   the term "rigorous system design" (rsd) denotes the design approach that is based on a formal, accountable and iterative process for deriving trustworthy and optimised implementations from models of application software, its execution platform and its external environment. ideally, a system implementation is derived from a set of appropriate high-level models by applying a sequence of semantics-preserving transformations.   the ambition of metrid is to promote the use of formal methods, in general, and the rsd approach, in particular, in the industrial applications and, reciprocally, bring the attention of the formal methods researchers to such industrial applications in order to develop realistic case-studies and guide the evolution of tools. striving towards this ambitious goal, we have solicited contributions of three types:   - regular s, presenting original research   - case study s, ing the evaluation of existing modelling, analysis, transformation and code generation formalisms and tools on realistic examples of significant size   - tool s, describing new tool prototypes supporting the rsd flow and enhancements of existing ones   we have received 13 submissions (7 regular, 4 tool and 2 case study s), whereof 8 have been accepted for presentation at the workshop:   - 5 regular s   - 2 tool s   - 1 case study    in this volume, these s are complemented by an invited  by joseph sifakis. 
  with the growing number of published scientific s world-wide, the need to evaluation and quality assessment methods for research s is increasing. scientific fields such as scientometrics, informetrics and bibliometrics establish quantified analysis methods and measurements for scientific s. in this area, an important problem is to predict the future influence of a published . particularly, early discrimination between influential s and insignificant s may find important applications. in this regard, one of the most important metrics is the number of citations to the , since this metric is widely utilized in the evaluation of scientific publications and moreover, it serves as the basis for many other metrics such as h-index. in this , we propose a novel method for predicting long-term citations of a  based on the number of its citations in the first few years after publication. in order to train a citations prediction model, we employed artificial neural networks which is a powerful machine learning tool with recently growing applications in many domains including image and text processing. the empirical experiments show that our proposed method out-performs state-of-the-art methods with respect to the prediction accuracy in both yearly and total prediction of the number of citations. 
  this  continues the discussion of the representation of ontologies in the first-order logical environment fole. according to gruber, an ontology defines the primitives with which to model the knowledge resources for a community of discourse. these primitives, consisting of classes, relationships and properties, are represented by the entity-relationship-attribute era data model of chen. an ontology uses formal axioms to constrain the interpretation of these primitives. in short, an ontology specifies a logical theory. a series of three s by the author provide a rigorous mathematical representation for the era data model in particular, and ontologies in general, within fole. the first two s, which provide a foundation and superstructure for fole, represent the formalism and semantics of (many-sorted) first-order logic in a classification form corresponding to ideas discussed in the information flow framework (iff). the third  will define an interpretation of fole in terms of the transformational passage, first described in (kent, 2013), from the classification form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form, thereby defining the formalism and semantics of first-order logicalrelational database systems. two s will provide a precise mathematical basis for fole interpretation: the current  develops the notion of a fole relational table following the relational model of codd, and a follow-up  will develop the notion of a fole relational database. both of these s expand on material found in the  (kent, 2011). although the classification form follows the entity-relationship-attribute data model of chen, the interpretation form follows the relational data model of codd. in general, the fole representation uses a conceptual structures approach, that is completely compatible with formal concept analysis and information flow. 
  some points related to the exponential instability of n-body gravitating systems and which are misinterpreted in various s are clarified. exponential instability is a phenomenon essentially responsible for the relaxation, evolutionary, morphological and other properties of certain type of galaxies and star clusters. 
  for true insight into the nature of dark energy, measurements of the precision and accuracy of the supernovaacceleration probe (snap) are required. precursor or scaled-down experiments are unavoidably limited, even for distinguishing the cosmological constant. this white  presents an overview of the necessity for snap and the role of precursor experiments; accompanying white s detail the supernovae and weak lensing parts of the experiment.

  this  is the first in a series of three s concerning the surface t times t. in this  we study the degeneration of t times t and the regeneration of its degenerated object. we study the braid monodromy and its regeneration. 
  this  investigates the doubly exponential ideal membership property of the mayr-meyer ideals from the point of view of their associated primes. a doubly-exponential upper bound on the set of associated primes is proved.   in the  a new family of ideals emerges which also has the doubly exponential ideal membership property. more on the new family can be found in author's  "a new family of ideals with the doubly exponential ideal membership property". 
  this  considers q-fano 3-folds x with \rho=1. the aim is to determine the maximal fano index f of x. we prove that f&lt;= 19, and that in case of equality, the hilbert series of x equals that of weighted projective space pp(3,4,5,7). from the previous version, we restrict the list of all possibilities of x to the case f&gt;8. it will appear in a forthcoming . 
  this  is a continuation of the  (a.g.ramm, amer. math. monthly, 108, n 9, (2001), 855-860), where bounded fredholm operators are studied. the theory of bounded linear fredholm-type operators is presented in many texts. this  is written for a broad audience and the author tries to give simple and short arguments. 
  this  is being withdrawn because an error was discovered in lemma 4.3. although the rest of the  appears to be correct, this error invalidates the proof of theorem 3.1 and theorem 3.3. 
  the duality triads were defined in the preceding .(arxiv: math.gm0402260 v 1 feb. 2004). notation, enumeration of formulas and references is therefore to be continued hereby. in this  fibonomial triangle and further pascal-like triangles including q-gaussian one are given explicit interpretation as discrete time dynamical systems as it is the case with all duality triads. 
  this  has been withdrawn due to an error in the proof. the  implicitly assumed that every homotopically trivial knot is related to the unknot by negative crossings, which is false (as was pointed out to the author by peter ozsvath). 
  this  gives one set of axioms for origami constructions, and describes the set of constructible points under these axioms. the determination of the set of cunstructible points for this particular set of axioms is related to hilbert's 17 th problem. 
  in the  stochastic volterra equations of nonscalar type in hilbert space are studied. the aim of the  is to provide some results on stochastic convolution and mild solutions to those volterra equations. the motivation of the  comes from a model of aging viscoelastic materials. the pseudo-resolvent approach is used.

  this is the second  of our series of s on one dimensional conformal metric flows. in this  we continue our studies of the one dimensional conformal metric flows, which were introduced in math.ap0611254. we prove the global existence and convergence of the one dimensional yamabe and affine flows. furthermore, we obtain exponential convergence of the metrics under these flows. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors due to the fact that the webs considered in the  are ``veronese-like webs'' which are different from veronese webs. 
  the  will be published in jotp.   in the  we prove holder continuity for ceratian classes of processes with bounded increments. the  generalizes results obtained by kwapien and rosinski in sample h{\"o}lder continuity of stochastic processes and majorizing measures. \textit{seminar on stochastic analysis, random fields and applications iv, progr. in probab.} {\bf 58}, 155--163. birkh{\"a}user, basel. 
  recent s by kievsky, viviani, and rosati are commented. it is pointed out that the techniques for treatment few-body reactions and bound states in the framework of the hyperspherical approach presented in those s as original ones were in fact known and have been applied previously.

  this  has been withdrawn by the authors, due to the discovery of  0201028 which predates it and contains most of it's results. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author. the central result is now included in quant-ph0309056 (as in the journal publication!). an erratum on the heisenberg perturbation series estimate is also included therein. 
  the present  is the continuation of the  "nonlinear field theory i". in the  it is shown that a fully correspondence between the quantum and the nonlinear electromagnetic forms of the dirac electron theory exists, so that each element of the dirac theory acquires the known electrodynamics meaning and reversely 
  in the preceding  quant-ph0312060 we considered a general model of an atom with n energy levels interacting with n-1 external laser fields and constructed a rabi oscillation in the case of n =3, 4 and 5.   in the  we present a systematic method getting along with computer to construct a rabi oscillation in the general case.

  this  has been withdrawn by the authors. 
  this  has been removed by arxiv administrators because it plagiarizes gr-qc0410004, gr-qc0603075, and others.   this  also has excessive overlap with the following s also written by the authors or their collaborators: gr-qc0608111, and others. 
  some results on the discontinuity properties of the lempert function and the kobayashi pseudometric in the spectral ball are given. 
  we provide supplementary appendices to the  misere quotients for impartial games. these include detailed solutions to many of the octal games discussed in the , and descriptions of the algorithms used to compute most of our solutions. 
  this  is a short commentary on the 2005  in nature by s. rainville et al., which claimed to be ``the most precise direct test of the famous equation", e = mc^2. this communication is directed only to the readers who are familiar with the earlier s by the author on the subject of mass-energy equivalence. 
  the purpose of this  is to point out that `supremum' in two inequalities of brooks should be replaced with `infimum'.   the results of this  are already known by professor higuci. hence, i want to delete this  from this preprint server. 
  this  has been withdrawn. see v1 still available to understand the problem: proposition 2.2 is false. the error in the proof is in claim (3). then, the whole  collapses. we do not have any correction for now. we apologize to everyone. 
  we demonstrate conclusively that there is no "open access advantage" for s from the astrophysical journal. the two to one citation advantage enjoyed by s deposited in the arxiv e-print server is due entirely to the nature and timing of the deposited s. this may have implications for other disciplines. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors because it has been merged with  arxiv:0903.3501v1 [math.dg] 
  this  is a companion to our prior  arxiv:0705.4619 on the `small ball inequality in all dimensions.' in it, we address a more restrictive inequality, and obtain a non-trivial, explicit bound, using a single essential estimate from our prior . the prior bound was not explicit and much more involved. 
  we withdraw our  for one doubt on one of equations .due to this reason we will check again our calculation and replace the revised version of this .

  this  has been withdrawn by the authors due to a crucial error in a bound on page 19 and some other errors earlier in the . 
  this is the first of two s on partition functions and the index theory of transversally elliptic operators. in this  we only discuss algebraic and combinatorial issues related to partition functions. the applications to index theory will appear in a subsequent . 
  this  has been withdrawn temporarily by the authors, because we are waiting for referee  of the  submitted to apj. 
  we provide some examples which give evidence to the conjectures contained in my  "finiteness of p-divisible sets of multiple harmonic sums" (math.nt0303043). all the main theoretical results can be found in that . 
  in this  we show that the piecewise linear map f(x) = px for x in [0,1p], and sx-sp for x in (1p,1], p &gt; 1, 0 &lt; s &lt; 1 which has an expanding, onto branch and a contracting branch is eventually piecewise expanding and exact. 
  on june 15, 1876, the proceedings of the royal society of london published a  by mr. w. h. l. russell entitled "on certain integrals". the  starts with "the following are certain integrals which will, i hope, be found interesting". the rest of the  is simply a list of 12 integrals. we provide a list of 12 integrals that we hope would be interesting. 
  this is an expository  which explores the ideas of the authors'  "from affine geometry to complex geometry", arxiv:0709.2290. we explain the basic ideas of the latter  by going through a large number of concrete, increasingly complicated examples. 
  these notes cover background material on trees which are used in the  `on uniqueness of the signature of a path of variation and the reduced path group'. 
  in this  we give solutions of certain diophantine equations related to triangular and tetrahedral numbers and propose several problems connected with these numbers.   the material of this  was presented in part at the 11th international workshop for young mathematicians - number theory, krak\'{o}w, 14th-20th september 2008. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author due to a new work in [arxiv:0901.0456v4] which can contain the results in this . 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors, because it has been made obsolete by the detailed expositions in our s in arxiv:0812.4885 (the mathematics part) and arxiv:0812.4737 (the economics part). 
  in his  "finite groups have many conjugacy classes" (j. london math. soc (2) 46 (1992), 239-249), l. pyber proved the to date best general lower bounds for the number of conjugacy classes of a finite group in terms of the order of the group. in this  we strengthen the main results in pyber's . 
  this, fourth  of the series (see previous s in refs.[1-3]) derives approximate equations for future numerical studies of initial evolution of hurricanes, develops new analytical models of hurricane genesis and maturing, and presents simple results, which seems to be in accord with observations. several remarks on tornados are also made at the end of the . 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors as they feel it inappropriate to publish this  for the time being.

  this  has been withdrawn by the authors because it has been combined with "higher auslander algebras admitting trivial maximal orthogonal subcategories" (arxiv:0903.0761) together. please see the new version of the latter  for the details. 
  by the technique of 3-fold mori theory, we prove that the moduli space whose general point parameterizes a couple of a smooth curve of genus 4 and a halfcanonical divisor with vanishing global section is rational. 
  we consider surface links in the 4-space which are presented by the form of simple branched coverings over the standard torus, which we call torus-covering links. in this , we study unknotting numbers of torus-covering links. in some cases, we can determine the unknotting numbers. 
  this  gives answers to questions formulated as open in the  "on state observability in deterministic finite automata" by a. mateescu and gh. paun. specifically, it demonstrates that for all k &gt;= 2, the families of regular languages acceptable by deterministic finite automata with no more than k semi-observable states, denoted by tk, are anti-afl's, and that the family t1 differs in the closure property under kleene +. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors. our basic argument on the gauge invariance presented in this  cannot withstand the criticism which has been drawn to our attention by several colleagues. 
  this  is about a new way for programming distributed applications: the service-oriented one. it is a concept  based upon our experience in developing a theory and a language for programming services. both the theoretical formalization and the language interpreter showed us the evidence that a new programming paradigm exists. in this  we illustrate the basic features it is characterized by. 
  we derive the weak value deflection given in a  by dixon et al. (phys. rev. lett. 102, 173601 (2009)) both quantum mechanically and classically. this  is meant to cover some of the mathematical details omitted in that  owing to space constraints. 
  the  by sato and kobayashi in 1977 studied the cosmological effects of a massive neutrino and obtained constraints on its properties. this  initiated many studies to use cosmology as a laboratory of particle physics or to use particle physics to explore the very early universe. 
  in this , expansions for the maximum likelihood estimator of location and its distribution funtion are extended to fifth order. since the proofs are straightforward extentions of proofs given in earlier s for orders less than the fifth, they are not given here. the purpose of the  is mainly to present the higher order expansions. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author. the velocity structure of the broad-line region is reflective of the radiation pressure over much longer timescales than are probed by year-to-year changes in reverberation mapping results. hence, the 's test of the marconi et al. model is not valid.

  given a representation of the circle group by semiclassical fourier integral operators, we construct an algebra of semiclassical pseudodifferential operators that are a quantum analogue of the notion of symplectic cutting of lerman, and we prove an associated szeg\"o limit theorem. 
  in this  we show that there are "e_0 many" orbit inequivalent free actions of the free groups f_n, 2\leq n\leq\infty, by measure preserving transformations on a standard borel probability space. in particular, there are uncountably many such actions. 
  we comment on the recent  by srivastava and dwivedi (j. astrophs. astr. {\bf 28}, 1, 2007). in the said  the derived dispersion relation \nu \eta \cos^4 \theta k^4 + [v_a^2 - i \omega (\nu + \eta)] \cos^2 \theta k^2 - \omega^2 = 0 seems to be in error. consequently, the conclusion drawn in their  are not reliable. 
  this  has been withdrawn. 
  in a recent , vink et al. analyzed some spectropolarimetry data of o-type stars. here we comment on our disagreement with some points presented in this , with the hope of helping to fully grasp the scientific implication of these measurements.

  the main theorem of the  shows that a smooth manifold which is homeomorphic to s^2xs^2 and has nonvanishing ozsvath-szabo invariant does not admit a perfect morse function. i am withdrawing the  because it is unclear to me if such a manifold exists. 
  this  is based on the 100 most cited s in astronomy for each year from 2000 to 2009 and from 1995 and 1990. the main findings are: the total number of authors of the top 100 articles per year has more than tripled. this is seen most strongly in s with more than 6 authors. the yearly number of s with 5 or fewer authors has declined over the same time period. the most highly cited s tend to have the largest number of authors and visa versa. the distribution of normalized citation counts versus ranking is constant from year to year except for the top ranked half dozen or so s. it is closely approximated by a power law. the s that show the most divergence from the power law all have a high number of citations and are based on large surveys. the average page length of the top 100 s is one and a half times that for astronomy s in general. the same 5 journals (a&amp;a, aj, apj, apjs, and mnras) account for 80 to 85% of the total citations for each year of all the journals in the category "astronomy and astrophysics" by isi's journal citation s. these same 5 journals account for 77% of the 1000 most cited s. a significant number of articles originally ranked in the top 100 for a year, drop out after 2 to 3 years and are replaced by other articles. most of the drop-outs deal with extra-galactic astronomy; their replacements deal with non-extra-galactic topics. indicators of internet access to astronomical web sites such as data archives and journal repositories show increases of between factors of three and ten or more i propose that there are close complementarities between the communication capabilities that internet usage enables and the strong growth in numbers of authors of the most highly cited s. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author. in this short  i will put in evidence a problem nested in ozawa's effort to block von neumann's chains and in his attributing the wave-collapse to a interaction between systems. this suggests distinguishing sharply the mathematical world from the phenomenological one. 
  in this  we prove an inequality for individual and uniform diophantine exponents in the case of simultaneous approximation. this inequality is better than jarnik's for small values of the uniform exponent. 
  a nonlocal interaction is not necessarily expressed by the deformation of commutators, so the  is withdrawn. 
  this  is around the topics i discussed in the lecture i gave at the isaac newton institute in cambridge, july 2009, in the introductory workshop. this  can be read as a companion to my  [sa\"i di], where detailed proofs can be found.

  the  studies banach spaces satisfying the littlewood-paley-rubio de francia property lpr_p, 2 \leq p &lt; \infty. the  shows that every banach lattice whose 2-concavification is a umd banach lattice has this property. the  also shows that every space having lpr_q also has lpr_p with q \leq p &lt; \infty. 
  we show that the only eigenvalues of this operator are 0 and 1. 
  we present an analysis of the scientific ("refereed")  productivity of the current largest (diameter &gt;8 m) ground-based optical(-infrared) telescopes during the ten year period from 2000 to 2009. the telescopes for which we have gathered and analysed the scientific publication data are the two 10 m keck telescopes, the four 8.2 m very large telescopes (vlt), the two 8.1 m gemini telescopes, the 8.2 m subaru telescope, and the 9.2 m hobby-eberly telescope (het). we have analysed the rate of s published in various astronomical journals produced by using these telescopes. while the total numbers of s from these observatories are largest for the vlt followed by keck, gemini, subaru, and het, the number of s produced by each component of the telescopes are largest for keck followed by vlt, subaru, gemini, and het. in 2009, each telescope of the keck, vlt, gemini, subaru, and het observatories produced 135, 109, 93, 107, and 5 refereed s, respectively. we have shown that each telescope of the keck, vlt, gemini, and subaru observatories is producing 2.1 +- 0.9 nature and science s annually and the rate of these s among all the refereed s produced by using that telescope is 1.7 +- 0.8 %. extending this relation, we propose that this ratio of the number of nature and science s over the number of whole refereed s that will be produced by future extremely large telescopes (elts) will be remained similar. from the comparison of the publication trends of the above telescopes, we suggest that (i) having more than one telescope of the same kind at the same location and (ii) increasing the number of instruments available at the telescope are good ways to maximize the  productivity. 
  this  is a continuation of s: arxiv:0707.1766 [math.ag] and arxiv:0912.1577 [math.ag]. using the two-dimensional poisson formulas from these s and two-dimensional adelic theory we obtain the riemann-roch formula on a projective smooth algebraic surface over a finite field. 
  it has been argued by daryl bem in his 2011  that 8 out of 9 experiments yielded statistically significant results in favour of the psi effect. it is pointed out in this short communication that many of the results in the above mentioned  could be explained by using well known concepts in statistics such as confidence level and standard error of the sample mean. this short communication also discusses implied confidence level and confidence intervals in polling results. 
  this volume contains the s presented at the first edition of the doctoral consortium of the 5th international symposium on rules (ruleml 2011@ijcai) held on july 19th, 2011 in barcelona, as well as the poster session s of the ruleml 2011@ijcai main conference.

  we survey developments arising from milnor's 1958 , "on the existence of a connection with curvature zero" and his 1977 , "on fundamental groups of complete affinely flat manifolds". 
  this  builds on earlier work, where the authors described whittaker modules for the virasoro algebra. using a framework of batra and mazorchuk, the current  investigates a category of virasoro algebra modules that includes whittaker modules. results in this  include a classification of the simple modules in the category and a description of certain induced modules that are a natural generalization of simple whittaker modules. 
  an analog of the riemann hypothesis is proved in this . some new integral equations for the functions \pi(x) and r(x) follows. a new effect that is shown is that these function - with essentially different behavior - are the solutions of the similar integral equations.   \noindent this  is the english version of the  of reference \cite{1}. 
  the fourth  of our series of s entitled "differential geometry of microlinear frolicher spaces is concerned with jet bundles. we present three distinct approaches together with transmogrifications of the first into the second and of the second to the third. the affine bundle theorem and the equivalence of the three approaches with coordinates are relegated to a subsequent . 
  the first aim of this  is to define the dual timelike mannheim partner curves in dual lorentzian space d3 1, the second aim of this  is to obtain the relationships between the curvatures and the torsions of the dual timelike mannheim partner curves with respect to each other and the final aim of this  is to get the necessary and sufficient conditions for the dual timelike mannheim partner curves in d3 1 .

  this  is devoted to the construction of a solution for the "inhomogenous skew brownian motion" equation, which first appeared in a seminal  by sophie weinryb, and recently, studied by \'{e}tor\'e and martinez. our method is based on the use of the balayage formula. at the end of this  we study a limit theorem of solutions. 
  in the recent  [i.m.suslov, jetp {\bf 114} (2012) 107] a new scaling theory of electron localization was proposed. we show that numerical data for the quasi-one dimensional anderson model do not support predictions of this theory. 
  this  deals with the quadratic integers of small norms and asserts that in some sense r &gt;&gt; (log d)^2 is true for almost all real quadratic number fields. (a few errata is corrected.) 
  this is primarily a pedagogical . the  re-visits some well-known quantum information theory inequalities. it does this from a quantum bayesian networks perspective. the  illustrates some of the benefits of using quantum bayesian networks to discuss quantum sit (shannon information theory). 
  as the fourth  of our series of s concerned with axiomatic differential geometry, this  is devoted to the general jacobi identity supporting the jacobi identity of vector fields. the general jacobi identity can be regarded as one of the few fundamental results belonging properly to smootheology. 
  social network management interfaces should consider separation of contexts and tie strength. this  shows the design process upon building the social cheesecake, an interface that addresses both issues.  and screen prototyping were used in the design process.  prototype interactions helped to explore the metaphors in the domain, while screen prototype consolidated the model. the prototype was finally built using html5 and javascript. 
  this  contains material originally presented in the first submission of the  "on the optimal control of impulsive hybrid systems on riemannian manifolds" to siam journal on control and optimization on the 28th of february, 2012. in the revised version of the  the following sections are removed. 
  let \fa be an ideal of a d-dimensional commutative noetherian ring r. in this  we give some information on some last non-zero local cohomology modules known as top local cohomology modules in particular, h^{d-1}_{\fa}(r). 
  in the  regularity of solutions to stochastic volterra equations in a separable hilbert space is studied. sufficient conditions for the temporal and spatial regularity of stochastic convolutions corresponding to the equations under consideration are provided. the results obtained generalize some well-known regularity results for solutions to stochastic differential equations. the  is a continuation of previous author's s concerning stochastic volterra equations. 
  let k be a number field. this  considers arithmetic functions over k, that are, complex valued functions on the set of nonzero integral ideals in k. firstly we generalize some basic results on arithmetic functions. next we define the generalized ramanujan sums over k and show some properties. 
  this  has been withdrawn, see the replacement arxiv:1302.6670. 
  cloud computing is getting mature, and the interoperability and standardization of the clouds is still waiting to be solved. this  discussed the interoperability among clouds about message transmission, data transmission and virtual machine transfer. starting from ieee pioneering cloud computing initiative, this  discussed about standardization of the cloud computing, especially intercloud cloud computing. this  also discussed the standardization from the market-oriented view. 
  metric estimates are quantities that approximate the word metric of a finitely presented group up to multiplicative constants. in this , they are computed for some nilpotent groups and used to compute the distortion functions of several embeddings between them. 
  in this  we : the use of go in aqueous solution as a gate dielectric material, its application to a mos transistor based on organic semiconductor and the use of  as substrate material. 
  we have proved in this  that the lindel\" of hypothesis generates essential contraction of distances between consecutive odd-order zeros of the function z'(t). this  is the translation of the  \cite{11} into the english except part 8 that we added in order to point out the i. m. vinogradov' scepticism on possibilities of the method of trigonometric sums. 
  this , written in relation to the current developments in mathematics 2012 conference, discusses the recent s on perfectoid spaces. apart from giving an introduction to their content, it includes some open questions, as well as complements to the results of the previous s. 
  fractional pebbling is a generalization of black-white pebbling introduced recently. in this reasearch  we solve an open problem by proving a tight lower bound on the pebble weight required to fractionally pebble a balanced d-ary tree of height h. this bound has close ties with branching programs and the separation of p from nl. 
  we characterize functions of finite energy in the plane in terms of their traces on the lines that make up "graph " with squares of side length mn for all n, and certain \12-order sobolev norms on the graph  lines. we also obtain analogous results for functions of finite energy on two classical fractals: the sierpinski gasket and the sierpinski carpet. 
  differential equations have arithmetic analogues in which derivatives are replaced by fermat quotients; these analogues are called arithmetic differential equations and the present  is concerned with the "linear" ones. the equations themselves were introduced in a previous . in the present  we deal with the solutions of these equations as well as with the differential galois groups attached to the solutions. 
  in this , we study the k-neighbor bootstrap percolation process on the d-dimensional grid [n]^d, and show that the minimum number of initial vertices that percolate is (1-dk)n^d + o(n^{d-1}) when d&lt;=k&lt;=2d. this confirms a conjecture of pete. 
  in this  i present a comparison theorem for the waist of riemannian manifolds with positive sectional curvature. the main theorem of this  gives a partial positive answer to a conjecture formulated by m.gromov in [8]. the content of this  combines two aspects: classical volume comparison theorems of riemannian geometry, and geometric measure theoretic ideas stemming from almgren-pitts min-max theory 
  for the result on 1-quasiconformal maps, see the  by cowling and ottazzi. the result on quasiconformal maps on carnot groups with reducible first layer will appear in a forthcoming  by enrico le donne and xiangdong xie. 
  in this  we characterize multiplication operators induced by operator valued maps on banach function spaces. we also study multiplication semigroups and stability of these operators. 
  in this  we study abelian and metabelian quotients of braid groups on oriented surfaces with boundary components. we provide group presentations and we prove rigidity results for these quotients arising from exact sequences related to (generalised) fadell-neuwirth fibrations. 
  on riemann hypothesis it is proved in this  that the arc length of the riemann z-curve is asymptotically equal to the double sum of local maxima of the function z(t) on corresponding segment. this  is english remake of our  \cite{9}, with short appendix concerning new integral generated by jacob's ladders added. 
  this  presents a case study of agile scrum process followed in retail domain project. this  also reveals the impacts of cost of software quality, when agile scrum process is not followed efficiently. while analyzing the case study, the gaps were found and guidelines for process improvements were also suggested in this . 
  we correct mistakes in the  kuhlmann, f.-v.: value groups, residue fields and bad places of rational function fields, trans. amer. math. soc. 356 (2004) [arxiv:1003.5685] and  on recent new developments which settle cases left open in that . 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign error in equation 2 and some mistake in table 1 information. please let me for changing this information and updating this . 
  in this  we obtain some sharp hardy inequalities with weight functions that may admit singularities on the unit sphere.   in order to prove the main results of the  we use some recent sharp inequalities for the lowest eigenvalue of schr\"odinger operators on the unit sphere obtaind in the  [del]. 
  in this  we improve classical hardy-littlewood exponent 12 by about 16.6\% 62 years after the original result. this result is the first step to prove the selberg's hypothesis (1942). in order to reach our purpose we use discrete method. this  is the english version of our  \cite{4}. 
  this  analyzes the effect of the catalan programme icrea for the selection of talented researchers on the percentage of highly cited s of catalan universities 
  this  deals with a generalized sudoku problem and investigates the unicity of a given solution. we introduce constraint sets, which is a generalization of the rows, columns and blocks of a classical sudoku puzzle. the unicity property is characterized by three different properties. we describe unicity by permutations, by unicity cells and by rectangles. these terms are defined in this  and are illustrated with examples. throughout this  we are not concerned with the existence of a solution. 
  we show that given a 3-manifold y there is only a finite number of alternating knots k \subset s^3 such that y can be obtained by surgery on k. a very similar but somewhat not complete statement has been obtained in a recent preprint of lackenby and purcell. 
  this is a translation of a final . it contains proofs of some well-known positivstellens\"atze. the approach in this  differs in two respects from presentations in literature. we use the stone-weierstrass theorem directly to prove an inductive property, which makes the kadison-dubois theorem superfluous in our , and we also consider homogeneous and projective positivstellens\"atze. this leads us to a homogeneous version of schm\"udgen's theorem and a projective version of putinar's theorem. 
  it has been pointed out by counterexamples in a 2013  in the ieee transactions on computers [1], that there is an error in the previously ibid.\ in 2005 published  [2] on the construction of valid digit selection tables for srt type division and square root algorithms. the error has been corrected, and new results found on selection constants for maximally redundant digit sets. 
  in a 2013 , the author showed that the convolution of a compactly supported measure on the real line with a gaussian measure satisfies a logarithmic sobolev inequality (lsi). in a 2014 , the author gave bounds for the optimal constants in these lsis. in this , we give a simpler, elementary proof of this result. 
  the present  is mainly concerned with the blow-up phenomena and exponential decay of solution for a three-component camassa-holm equation. comparing with the result of hu, ect. in the [1], a new wave-breaking solution is obtained. the results of exponential decay of solution in our  cover and extent the corresponding results in [12, 19, 22]. 
  the  of domokos is "invariants of quivers and wreath products," and as in that  we use regev's double centralizer theorem for wreath products to study trace identities and invariant theory. in addition to extending to other algebras and groups, we also compute poincare series and prove embedding theorems. 
  the main subject of this  is the mean-value of the function |\zeta(s)|^{2k-1} in the critical strip. on lindel\" of hypothesis we give a solution to this question for some class of disconnected sets. this  is english version of our  \cite{5}. 
  the  deals with popular mathematics and mathematical education of talented students. the  is devoted to high school students mathematical conferences, problem contest for them, academical policy. the  was supported by grant rffi no 14-01-00548. 
  this  is about the technique of {\em shadow variables} that was used in the theory of monotone operators. in this , we use it to show that certain results that were originally proved for lower semicontinuous convex functions are in fact true for {\em marginable} convex functions. 
  in this , we show the trivializing number of all minimal diagrams of positive 2-bridge knots and study the relation between the trivializing number and the unknotting number for a part of these knots. 
  this  is part 1 of a series of s culminating in the result that measure preserving diffeomorphisms of the disc or 2-torus are unclassifiable. it also addresses another classical problem: which abstract measure preserving systems are realizable as smooth diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold? the main result of this  gives new symbolic representations of the anosov-katok diffeomorphisms. 
  we study algebro-geometric properties of determinantal loci of (n+1)th symmetric matrices and also their double covers for even ranks. their singularities, fano indices and birational geometries are studied in general. the double covers of symmetric determinantal loci of rank four are studied with special interest by noting their relation to the hilbert schemes of conics on grassmannians. 
  in this  we discuss various philosophical aspects of the hyperstructure concept extending networks and higher categories. by this discussion we hope to pave the way for applications and further developments of the mathematical theory of hyperstructures. 
  this is a continuation of a previous  by the same authors. in the former , it was proved that in order to obtain local uniformization for valuations centered on local domains, it is enough to prove it for rank one valuations. in this , we extend this result to the case of valuations centered on rings which are not necessarily integral domains and may even contain nilpotents. 
  we remove 52 from the set of prime partitionable numbers in a  by holsztynski and strube (1978), which also appears in a  by erdos and trotter in the same year. we establish equivalence between two different definitions in the two s, and further equivalence to the set of erdos-woods numbers. 
  putinar and vasilescu have given an algebraic characterization of hamburger moment sequences in several variables. in this  we give a characterization of sparse moment subsequences of hamburger moment sequences and consider the problem of completion of these moment subsequences. 
  in this  we include some derivations on a channel estimation method based on the use of dirty  coding. specifically, we analyze the proposed method, named dirty -based channel estimation (dpce), when the considered codebooks are high-dimensional lattices. 
  in the first two s, the author embarked on a study of classes of linear equations over integers satisfying a "farkas-type" property. as the third  in this study, the present  deals with another class of linear equations over integers that has a similar "farkas-type" property. furthermore it is shown that if an arbitrary system of equations over integers satisfies the conditions imposed by farkas' lemma then it has rational solutions of a special type. 
  this is a short communication in reference to the comments in (arxiv: 1605.05147) of our  in int. j. mod. phys. d 25, 1650051 (2016). we have tried to answer to the comments or criticism in the . 
  in this , considering the energy conditions we shall show that some of the energy conditions are violated in the vicinity of future singularities with the scale factor suggested by dabrowski - marosek. 
  in this , a group is called weakly amenable if its left regular representation is not uniformly isolated from the trivial representation. first examples of finitely generated non-amenable weakly amenable groups are constructed. 
  we analyze the role of first (leading) author gender on the number of citations that a  receives, on the publishing frequency and on the self-citing tendency. we consider a complete sample of over 200,000 publications from 1950 to 2015 from five major astronomy journals. we determine the gender of the first author for over 70% of all publications. the fraction of s which have a female first author has increased from less than 5% in the 1960s to about 25% today. we find that the increase of the fraction of s authored by females is slowest in the most prestigious journals such as science and nature. furthermore, female authors write 19\pm7% fewer s in seven years following their first  than their male colleagues. at all times s with male first authors receive more citations than s with female first authors. this difference has been decreasing with time and amounts to \sim6% measured over the last 30 years. to account for the fact that the properties of female and male first author s differ intrinsically, we use a random forest algorithm to control for the non-gender specific properties of these s which include seniority of the first author, number of references, total number of authors, year of publication, publication journal, field of study and region of the first author's institution. we show that s authored by females receive 10.4\pm0.9% fewer citations than what would be expected if the s with the same non-gender specific properties were written by the male authors. finally, we also find that female authors in our sample tend to self-cite more, but that this effect disappears when controlled for non-gender specific variables. 
  a translation of paul ehrenfest's 1933 , entitled "phase transitions in the usual and generalized sense, classified according to the singularities of the thermodynamic potential" is presented. some historical commentary about the 's context is also given. 
  this note contains additions to the  'clustered cell de in p-minimal structures' (arxiv:1612.02683). we discuss a question which was raised in that , on the order of clustered cells. we also consider a notion of cells of minimal order, which is a slight optimalisation of the theorem from the original . 
  the perfect cuboid problem is an old famous unsolved problem in mathematics concerning the existence or non-existence of a rectangular parallelepiped whose edges, face diagonals, and space diagonal are of integer lengths. recently walter wyss has published a  [arxiv:1506.02215] claiming a solution of this problem. the purpose of this  is to check out walter wyss's result. 
  the  "on the theory of storm" (zur sturmtheorie) is the last one max margules has published in 1906, just before to "bid farewell to meteorology" (using his words). the lack of english translation of this  might be filled by this attempt which can be certainly improved, however. 
  a weakly distance-regular digraph is 3-equivalenced if its attached association scheme is 3-equivalenced. in this , we classify the family of such digraphs under the assumption of the commutativity. 
  this  is a continuation of a previous  joint with dennis sullivan (arxiv:1704.04308). working in the context of commutative differential graded algebras, we study the ideal of the cohomology classes which can be annihilated by fibrations whose fiber has finite homological dimension. in the present  we identify these classes with certain higher products in cohomology. 
  a previous result in a  by buch and mihalcea relates the curve neighborhood of any schubert variety to the curve neighborhood of a point and introduces the idea of p-cosmall roots. in our , we prove a conjecture given in that same  about p-cosmall roots. we go on to provide explicit combinatorial conditions for a root to be p-cosmall. 
  in our  arxiv:1310.6289, we stated that acylindrical hyperbolicity of a group is invariant under commensurability up to finite kernels. unfortunately, the proof of this fact contained a gap. the goal of this erratum is to point out the gap and to correct the statements and proofs of results of arxiv:1310.6289 and the subsequent  arxiv:1501.03066 affected by it. 
  this  is a companion for the  "monoidal bousfield localizations and algebras over operads," part of the author's phd thesis. this  was written in 2015 for the first edition of "enchiridion: mathematics user's guides." more user's guides can be found at https:mathusersguides.com 
  in this , we generalize the cosmetic surgery conjecture to an n-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold and prove it under the assumption of another well-known conjecture in number theory, so called the zilber-pink conjecture. for n=1 and 2, we show them without the assumption. 
  this  is a continuation of the recent  of the author, where a certain reproducing kernel hilbert space x_{\mathcal{s}} was constructed. the norm in x_{\mathcal{s}} is related to a certain generalized isoperimetric inequality in {\mathbb r^2}. in the present  we give an alternative description of the space x_{\mathcal{s}}, which appears to be a sobolev space h^{1}[a,b] with some special norm. 
  revised translation of kaluza's historic 1921 , "zum unit\"atsproblem der physik," on 5-dimensional spacetime, used to unify gravity and electromagnetism. this version is based, in part, on a 1984 translation provided by t. muta, but revised and formatted using latex to closely match the original  in appearance and pagination. kaluza's original notation is restored. 
  the method of this  is my original creation. a new method for solving linear differential equations is proposed in this . the important conclusion of this  is that arbitrary order linear ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients can be solved by the method of recursion and reduction of order under some conditions which easily be satisfied in practical applications. 
  in this  we completely classify the homogeneous two-spheres, especially, the minimal homogeneous ones in the quaternionic projective space \textbf{hp}^n. according to our classification, more minimal constant curved two-spheres in \textbf{hp}^n are obtained than ohnita conjectured in the  "homogeneous harmonic maps into projective space, tokyo j math, 1990, 13(1): 87-116". 
  this  generalizes the 1977  of v.b. shehtman, which constructed the first kripke incomplete intermediate logic, by presenting a continuum of such logics. this version fixes an error in my simplified proof of incompleteness of shehtman's original logic. 
  this  had no abstract originally. a second-order symplectic integration algorithm for guiding center motion is presented. the algorithm is based on the poincar\'e (mid-point) generating function. 
  this  defends the design of hardware trojan proposed in the  "defeating hatch: building malicious ip cores" by defining the four critical properties which are required to be satisfied to classify it to belong to class of deterministic hardware trojan. this is to counter the claims of authors of hatch in their  "comments on defeating hatch". 
  this volume constitutes the pre-proceedings of the 26th international workshop on functional and logic programming (wflp 2018). it is formed of those s selected by the program committee for presentation at the workshop. after discussion at the workshop, the program committee will select a number of s to be invited for the second round of refereeing and selection for the formal proceedings. 
  in this appendix to a  [arxiv:1809.08623] by b. williams, we give birational equivalences between the models of the hilbert modular surfaces for {\mathbb q}(\sqrt{29}) and {\mathbb q}(\sqrt{37}) given there and those previously found by elkies and kumar. 
  in  i, greisen &amp; calabretta (2002) describe a generalized method for assigning physical coordinates to fits image pixels. this  implements this method for all spherical map projections likely to be of interest in astronomy. the new methods encompass existing informal fits spherical coordinate conventions and translations from them are described. detailed examples of header interpretation and construction are given. 
  since its launch in april 1990, the hubble space telescope (hst) has produced an increasing flow of scientific results. the large number of refereed publications based on hst data allows a detailed evaluation of the effectiveness of this observatory and of its scientific programs. this  presents the results of selected science metrics related to  counts, citation counts, citation history, high-impact s, and the most productive programs and most cited s, through the end of 2003. all these indicators point towards the high-quality scientific impact of hst. 
  volovik and kopnin make two seperate points regarding our recent  (s. h. simon and p. a. lee, prl 78, 1548 (1997); cond-mat9611133). first they note that the scaling regime we address in our  is limited by the curvature of the fermi surface, and secondly they note that the crossover scale derived in our  is incorrect. these points are valid and are discussed in this reply. with the exception of the incorrectly predicted crossover scale, the results of our  remain unchanged. 
  recently we discovered (cond-mat0212043) that the majority of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used in other s. here we show that a model, in which a scientist picks three random s, cites them,and also copies a quarter of their references accounts quantitatively for empirically observed citation distribution. simple mathematical probability, not genius, can explain why some s are cited a lot more than the other. 
  scientific communities are characterized by strong stratification. the highly skewed frequency distribution of citations of published scientific s suggests a relatively small number of active, cited s embedded in a sea of inactive and uncited s. we propose an analytically soluble model which allows for the death of nodes. this model provides an excellent description of the citation distributions for live and dead s in the spires database. further, this model suggests a novel and general mechanism for the generation of power law distributions in networks whenever the fraction of active nodes is small. 
  during the past decade, nine s have obtained increasingly strong consequences from the assumption that boolean or bounded-query hierarchies collapse. the final four s of this nine- progression actually achieve downward collapse---that is, they show that high-level collapses induce collapses at (what beforehand were thought to be) lower complexity levels. for example, for each k\geq 2 it is now known that if \psigkone=\psigktwo then \ph=\sigmak. this article surveys the history, the results, and the technique---the so-called easy-hard method---of these nine s. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors. it has been replaced by the s: "drawings of planar graphs with few slopes and segments" (math0606450) and "graph drawings with few slopes" (math0606446). 
  in this second of three short s, i introduce some of the basic concepts of space robotics with an emphasis on some specific challenging areas of research that are peculiar to the application of robotics to space infrastructure development. the style of these short s is pedagogical and the concepts in this  are developed from fundamental manipulator robotics. this second  considers the application of space manipulators to on-orbit servicing (oos), an application which has considerable commercial application. i provide some background to the notion of robotic on-orbit servicing and explore how manipulator control algorithms may be modified to accommodate space manipulators which operate in the micro-gravity of space. 
  an introductory  to the graph k-colorability problem. 
  this is a two-part, `2-in-1' . in part i, the introductory talk at `glafka--2004: iconoclastic approaches to quantum gravity' international theoretical physics conference is presented in  form (without references). in part ii, the more technical talk, originally titled ``abstract differential geometric excursion to classical and quantum gravity'', is presented in  form (with citations). the two parts are closely entwined, as part i makes general motivating remarks for part ii. 
  the original version of this  commented on a  by jaffe, jin, and tang (hep-ph9710561). that  has been revised, and my original comment no longer applies to the revised version. the original version of my comment (hep-ph9801217v1) provides a simple argument that two-particle correlations in parity-invariant fragmentation cannot provide a measurement of the helicity of the fragmenting quark. 
  in this , we will construct a gauge field model, in which the masses of gauge fields are non-zero and the local gauge symmetry is strictly preserved. a su(n) gauge field model is discussed in details in this . in the limit \alpha \longrightarrow 0 or \alpha \longrightarrow \infty, the gauge field model discussed in this  will return to yang-mills gauge field model. this theory could be regarded as theoretical development of yang-mills gauge field theory. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors. due fail of replacement of the . new version is hep-ph0201214. 
  this  is removed from the network permanently. the content in this  has now been put together with hep-th9310183. see the recently replaced and widely revised version of the latter. 
  i review the  of majorana about relativistic particles with arbitrary spin written in 1932. the main motivation for this s was the dissatisfaction about the negative energy solutions of the dirac equation. as such, the  became immediately obsolete due to the almost contemporaneous discovery of the positron. however, for the first time, the unitary representations of the lorentz group were introduced. majorana considered two particular representations (named, after him, majorana representations) which enjoy many interesting properties. a discussion about the reasons for its revival in the 60's is presented. 
  in this , i review the section 8 of v.v.shokurov's  '3-fold log flips'. 
  in a recent  of wolff the optimal decay of circular l^p means of compactly supported measures of finite energy was given for p&gt;=2, with application to falconer's distance problem. the question was then raised in that  as to whether any non-trivial improvement to these estimates were available for p &lt; 2. we answer this question in the negative. 
   withdrawn because of a gap in the proof of proposition 3 of thomas schick: "integrality of l2-betti numbers", math. ann. 317, 727-750 (arxiv.orgabsmath.gt0001101). most results of the withdrawn  were based on this proposition. 
  the present  have been replaced by the : hartogs-bochner type theorem in projective space (math.cv0011095) in which we prove the following hartogs-bochner type theorem: let m be a connected c^2 hypersurface of p_n(\mathbb{c}) (n\geq 2) which divides p_n(\mathbb{c}) in two connected open sets \omega_1 and \omega_2. then there exists i \in \{1,2\} such that c^{1} cr functions defined on m extends holomorphically to \omega_i. 
  this  proves that the maximum number of rational points on a smooth, absolutely irreducible genus 4 curve over the field of 8 elements is 25. the body of the  shows that 27 points is not possible using techniques from algebraic geometry. the appendix shows that 26 points is not possible by examining the zeta functions. 
  this  is withdrown 
  this is the second  in a series of s aimed at providing a geometric construction of modular functors and topological quantum field theories from conformal field theory building on the constructions in [tuy] and [knty].   we give a geometric construct of a modular functor for any simple lie-algebra and any level by twisting the constructions in [tuy] by a certain fractional power of the abelian theory first considered in [knty] and further studied in our first  [au1]. 
  this  was withdrawn by the author. the appearance of an author-written addendum [3] to the  [2] made our correction note [1] to that  superfluous and hence it is no longer available here.   [1] dror bar-natan and ofer ron, a correction to "groups of ribbon knots" by ka yi ng, no longer available. [2] ka yi ng, groups of ribbon knots, topology 37 (1998) 441-458.

  if a partition of a lattice in r^d is selfsimilar, it is called lattice substitution system (lss). such sets represent nonperiodic, but highly ordered structures. an important property of such structures is, whether they are model sets or not (equivalently, whether they are pure point diffractive or not). in this  two conditions are given, which can be used to show that a given lattice substitution system does not consist of model sets. 
  this  is an introduction to rational tangles, rational knots and links and their applications to dna. the  can be read as an introduction to our more technical s on rational tangles (math.gt0311499) and on rational knots (math.gt0212011). the present  includes a self-contained account of the tangle fraction from the point of view of the bracket polynomial, accounts of the classification theorems for rational tangles and rational knots (and of our new proofs of these results) and a description of the use of rational tangles in studying dna recombination. 
  this  has been withdrawn, because i have merged it with  i of the series, math.ag0312190. the main results of this  now appear in sections 7-9 of the revised version of math.ag0312190, with shortened and improved proofs. 
  let x be a pure n-dimensional complex analytic set in \mathbb{c}^n with an isolated singularity at 0. we study the cauchy-riemann operator on a deleted neighborhood of the singular point 0 in x. 
  the s math.qa0403527 and math.qa0409414 v.1 are now merged together. the final version is available at math.qa0409414 v.2. to avoid duplication of s, math.qa0403527 is now removed. 
  this  is the extended introduction of a serie of s about modelling t-homotopy by refinement of observation. the notion of t-homotopy equivalence is discussed. a new one is proposed and its behaviour with respect to other construction in dihomotopy theory is explained. 
  this  provides the asymptotic analysis of the loss probability in the gim1n queueing system as n increases to infinity. the approach of this  is alternative to that of the recent s of choi and kim [2000] and choi et al [2000] and based on application of modern tauberian theorems with remainder. this enables us to simplify the proofs of the results on asymptotic behavior of the loss probability of the abovementioned  of choi and kim [2000] as well as to obtain some new results. 
  in this , we give a class of reconstructible graphs. 
  this  is an appendix to the  "random walks on free products of cyclic groups" by j.mairesse and f.math\'eus. it contains the details of the computations and the proofs of the results concerning the examples treated there. 
  this is the part ii of our series of two s, "clemens' conjecture: part i", "clemens' conjecture: part ii". continuing from part i, in this  we turn our attention to general quintic threefolds. in a universal quintic threefold x, we construct a family of quasi-regular deformation b_b such that the generic member in this family is non-deviated, but some special member is deviated. by the result from part i, this is impossible unless there is no one parameter family of smooth rational curves in a generic quintic threefold. 
  this  is an appendix to the  ``randomly growing braid on three strands and the manta ray'' by j. mairesse and f. math\'eus (to appear in the annals of applied probability). it contains the details of some computations, and the proofs of some results concerning the examples treated there, as well as some extensions. 
  it is proved that the rectilinear crossing number of every graph with bounded tree-width and bounded degree is linear in the number of vertices.   **** this  has been withdrawn by the author. ****   the results have been superseeded by the author's  with jan arne telle: "planar des and the crossing number of graphs with an excluded minor", http:arxiv.orgmath0604467. 
  in this  we study the linearizability problem for 3-webs on a 2-dimensional manifold. with an explicit computation based on the theory developed in the  "on the linearizability of 3-webs" (nonlinear analysis 47, (2001) pp. 2643-2654), we examine a 3-web whose linearizability was claimed in the same . we show that, contrary to the statement of the s "on the blaschke conjecture for 3-webs" (arxiv: math.dg0411460) and "on linearization of planar three-webs and blaschke's conjecture", (c.r.acad. sci. paris, ser. i. vol. 341. num 3 (2005)), this particular web is linearizable. we compute explicitly the affine deformation tensor and the corresponding flat linear connection adapted to the web which linearizes it. 
  the aim of this  and its sequel is to introduce and classify the holonomy algebras of the projective tractor connection. after a brief historical background, this  presents and analyses the projective cartan and tractor connections, the various structures they can preserve, and their geometric interpretations. preserved subbundles of the tractor bundle generate foliations with ricci-flat leaves. contact- and einstein-structures arise from other reductions of the tractor holonomy, as do u(1) and sp(1, \mathbb{h}) bundles over a manifold of smaller dimension. 
  the aim of this  and its prequel is to introduce and classify the irreducible holonomy algebras of the projective tractor connection. this is achieved through the construction of a `projective cone', a ricci-flat manifold one dimension higher whose affine holonomy is equal to the tractor holonomy of the underlying manifold. this  uses the result to enable the construction of manifolds with each possible holonomy algebra. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors because the  is largely revised and improved, and to appear in mechanics research communications. 
  to this day, the two-slit electron interference pattern remains shrouded in an inordinate mystery. it continues to defy a logical and rational explanation. this  will postulate a new "characteristic" pertaining to the electron. if this characteristic is correct, the mystery of the two-slit pattern will be eliminated. furthermore, the theory is testable. fundamentally, the tests entail running the experiment in slightly different ways. if the theory is correct, we shall see patterns that we've never previously witnessed. 
  this is the first  by gunnar nordstr{\"o}m (1881--1923) on his five dimensional theory. in his summary he states: ''it is shown, that a unifying treatment of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields is possible, if one considers the four dimensional spacetime world to be a surface in a five dimensional world.'' this  was followed by two other s written by the gunnar nordstr{\"o}m during the one year period 1914--1915, on the same subject, which are also made available here. 
  the present  establishes a connection between the lie algebra w_{1+infty} and the bispectral problem. we show that the manifolds of bispectral operators obtained by darboux transformations on powers of bessel operators are in one to one correspondence with the manifolds of tau-functions lying in the w_{1+infty}-modules m_beta introduced in our previous  hep-th9510211. an immediate corollary is that they are preserved by hierarchies of symmetries generated by subalgebras of w_{1+infty}.   this  is the last of a series of s (hep-th9510211, q-alg9602010, q-alg9602011) on the bispectral problem. 
  this  has been withdrawn because of a gap in the proof of lemma 3.10. the main reults in this  have now been proved, and extended in the following s:   s. ariki and a. mathas, the number of simple modules of the hecke algebras of type g(r,1,n)   s. ariki, on the classification of simple modules for cyclotomic hecke algebras of type g(m,1,n) and kleshchev multipartitions 
  in this continuation , we apply the general relativistic quantum theory for one particle systems, derived in  ii of this series, to a simple problem: the quantum schwartzchild problem, where one particle of mass {\it m% } gravitates around a massive body. the results thus obtained reveal that, in the realm of such a theory, the negative mass conjecture we made in  iv of this series is, indeed, adequate. it is shown that gravitation is responsible for the loss of energy quantization. we relate this property with the ideas of irreversibility and time arrow. 
  the computer code on which this  relied contained an error. when corrected, the monte carlo evaluation of the ground state occupation is consistent with the conventional grand canonical calculation. hence, the original version of this  has been withdrawn.

  this  proposes a basic theory on physical reality and a new foundation for quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. it presents a scenario not only to solve the problem of the arbitrariness on the operator ordering for the quantization procedure, but also to clarify how the classical-limit occurs. this  is the first of the three s into which the previous  quant-ph9906130 has been separated for readability. 
  in a previous , we showed how entanglement of formation can be defined as a minimum of the quantum conditional mutual information (a.k.a. quantum conditional information transmission). in classical information theory, the arimoto-blahut method is one of the preferred methods for calculating extrema of mutual information. in this , we present a new method, akin to the arimoto-blahut method, for calculating entanglement of formation. we also present several examples computed with a computer program called causa comun that implements the ideas of this . 
  this  continues research initiated in quant-ph0201022 . the main subject here is the so-called edmonds' problem of deciding if a given linear subspace of square matrices contains a nonsingular matrix . we present a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem for linear subspaces satisfying a special matroids motivated property, called in the  the edmonds-rado property . this property is shown to be very closely related to the separability of bipartite mixed states . one of the main tools used in the  is the quantum permanent introduced in quant-ph0201022 . 
  we review both the einstein, podolsky, rosen (epr)  about the completeness of quantum theory, and schrodinger's responses to the epr . we find that both the epr  and schrodinger's responses, including the cat paradox, are not consistent with the current understanding of quantum theory and thermodynamics.   because both the epr  and schrodinger's responses play a leading role in discussions of the fascinating and promising fields of quantum computation and quantum information, we hope our review will be helpful to researchers in these fields. 
  a remark on a  by birkar-cascini-hacon-mckernan. 
  this  revisits previous s related to the theory of relativity. afterwards, a reconsideration of the hypothesis of ether-dragging is discussed. the ether is compatible with the theory of relativity and historical experiments; this  explains the michelson-morley experiment using the ether-dragging hypothesis without the orthodox interpretation that the speed c is a fixed constant in terms of any system of inertial coordinates. 
  comments on six s published by s.p. anjali devi and r. kandasamy in heat and mass transfer, zamm, mechanics research communications, international communications in heat and mass transfer, communications in numerical methods in engineering, journal of computational and applied mechanics   in conclusion all the above s are of very low quality, written without care and are partly or completely wrong. 
  the  that was here is a preprint that was never turned into a proper . in particular it does not have enough citations to the literature. the  "the slice algorithm for irreducible de of monomial ideals" contains a much better description of the label algorithm than this preprint did. if you still wish to read the original preprint then access the arxiv's version 1 of this , instead of version 2 which is what you are reading now. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in the proofs. the error has been corrected and the  has been expanded in arxiv:0910.5327 
  suppose that f : f_p^n -&gt; [0,1] has expected value t in [p^(-n9),1] (so, the density t can be quite low!). furthermore, suppose that support(f) has no three-term arithmetic progressions. then, we develop non-trivial lower bounds for f_j, which is the jth largest fourier coefficient of f.   this result is similar in spirit to that appearing in an earlier  [1] by the author; however, in that  the focus was on the ``small'' fourier coefficients, whereas here the focus is on the ``large'' fourier coefficients. furthermore, the proof in the present  requires much more sophisticated arguments than those of that other . 
  this  summarizes and discusses the methodological research in human genetic linkage analysis, leading up to and following from the  of c. a. b. smith presented as a royal statistical society discussion  in 1953. this  was given as the fisher xxvii memorial lecture, in cambridge, december 4, 2006. 
  in this series of seven s, predominantly by means of elementary analysis, we establish a number of identities related to the riemann zeta function. whilst this  is mainly expository, some of the formulae ed in it are believed to be new, and the  may also be of interest specifically due to the fact that most of the various identities have been derived by elementary methods.

  this is an expository review  elaborating on the proof of the martingale functional central limit theorem (fclt). this  also reviews tightness and stochastic boundedness, highlighting one-dimensional criteria for tightness used in the proof of the martingale fclt. this  supplements the expository review  pang, talreja and whitt (2007) illustrating the ``martingale method'' for proving many-server heavy-traffic stochastic-process limits for queueing models, supporting diffusion-process approximations. 
  global in time dispersive estimates for the schroedinger and wave evolutions are obtained on manifolds with conical ends whose hamiltonian flow exhibits trapping. this  deals with the case of initial data with "zero angular momentum". 
  the present  is a continuation of [13], [14] of the authors. specifically, the  considers the md5-foliations associated to connected and simply connected md5-groups such that their lie algebras have 4-dimensional commutative derived ideal. in the , we give the topological classification of all considered md5-foliations. a description of these foliations by certain fibrations or suitable actions of \mathbb{r}^{2} and the connes' c*-algebras of the foliations which come from fibrations are also given in the . 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author, due a crucial error in the optimization. for the last one month i have been trying to remove the error, but it seems to take a lot of time so i decided to withdraw this  for the moment. 
  here we give detailed derivations and provide additional examples to the main : arxiv:0706.0212. in particular, we discuss the scaling behavior of observables like correlation functions and density of excitations. we also analyze effects of nonintegrability of the bose-hubbard model on the long-time dynamics of the correlation functions. in addition we explicitly consider several interacting models, where we are able to analyze slow dynamics and classify it according to the regimes suggested in the main . 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors. some of the arguments developed in the  are erroneous. they will be rectified in a later publication. 
  the aim of the present  is on the one hand to produce examples supporting the conclusion of y. namikawa in remark 2.8 of \cite{n} and improving considerations of example 1.11 of the same . on the other hand, it is intended to give a geometric interpretation of the rigidity properties of some trees of exceptional rational curves, as observed by namikawa, which can be obtained by factorizing small resolutions through nodal threefolds. 
  this  presents an improved result on the negative-binomial monte carlo technique analyzed in a previous  for the estimation of an unknown probability p. specifically, the confidence level associated to a relative interval [p\mu_2, p\mu_1], with \mu_1, \mu_2 &gt; 1, is proved to exceed its asymptotic value for a broader range of intervals than that given in the referred , and for any value of p. this extends the applicability of the estimator, relaxing the conditions that guarantee a given confidence level. 
  this  is an english translation of chapter nine of the book "adams spectral sequence and stable homotopy groups of spheres" by jinkun lin (in chinese)(sciences press, beijing 2007). in this , a sequence of new indecomposable families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres such as h_0h_n,h_nb_n,h_0h_nh_m,h_0(h_mb_{n-1}-b_{m-1}h_n) families was detected. the proof of all the detections was stated in this  in based on several published s by the author. 
  this  has been withdrawn due to an error in the proof of the termination of the algorithm. moreover, some ideas of this  are a joint work with john perry and it is inappropriate to mention only me as an author. john perry was in spite of the statement in the acknowledgment of previous versions not proofreading this . recently we have found a new solution for ensuring f5's termination, which can be found here : arxiv:1006.0318. 
  title: an unlikely result authors: t.m. other comments: this  has been withdrawn abstract: this  has been withdrawn by the author due to the fact that some of the results turned out to be known. 
  it is a correction  on "p.j. wan and c.w. yi, "coverage by randomly deployed wireless sensor networks", ieee transaction on information theory, vol.52, no.6, june 2006."   in the above , lemma (4), on page 2659 play the key role for deriving the main results in the . the statement as well as the proof of lemma (4), page 2659, is not correct. we have given the correct version of lemma. this change in lemma leads a drastic change in all the result derived in the above . 
  in the previous , we construct new subvarieties in the varieties of power sums for certain quartic hypersurfaces. in this , we show that these quartics coincide with the scorza quartics of general pairs of trigonal curves and ineffective theta characteristics. among other applications, we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture of dolgachev and kanev on the existence of the scorza quartics for any general pairs of curves and ineffective theta characteristics. we also give descriptions of the moduli spaces of trigonal even spin curves. for curves of genus 4, we deepen this description in the next . 
  a real bott tower is obtained as the orbit space of the n-torus t^n by the free action of an elementary abelian 2-group (\mathbb{z}_2)^n. this  deals with the classification of 5-dimensional real bott towers and study certain type of n-dimensional real bott towers (n\geq 6). 
  this  discusses the formulations of the past in quantum mechanics. 
  this  is a guide for the pure mathematician who would like to know more about cryptography based on group theory. the  gives a brief overview of the subject, and provides pointers to good textbooks, key research s and recent survey s in the area. 
  the main result of this , simon's conjecture for fibered knots, was previously proven by silver and whitten math.gt0405462 with essentially the same proof. this  is therefore being withdrawn. the author would like to apologize for having missed this. 
  we describe all pseudo-riemannian metrics on closed surfaces whose geodesic flows admit nontrivial integrals quadratic in momenta. as an application, we solve the beltrami problem on closed surfaces and prove the nonexistence of quadratically-superintegrable metrics of nonconstant curvature on closed surfaces 
  we consider l^p two weight inequalities for maximal truncations of dyadic calderon-zygmund operators. in the case of one weight being doubling, a characterization is given, and for the general case, sufficient conditions are given, including standard and non-standard testing conditions. the arguments of this  parallel the authors prior work arxiv:0805.4711, but in this  are much easier. 
  the results of this  have been greatly superseded by those in the  "contact geometry and isosystolic inequalities" (arxiv:1109.4253) by the same authors. 
  this is the fifth in a series of s where we prove a conjecture of deser and schwimmer regarding the algebraic structure of ``global conformal invariants''; these are defined to be conformally invariant integrals of geometric scalars. the conjecture asserts that the integrand of any such integral can be expressed as a linear combination of a local conformal invariant, a divergence and of the chern-gauss-bonnet integrand.   the present  complements [6] in reducing the purely algebraic results that were used in [3,4 to certain simpler lemmas, which will be proven in the last  in this series, [8]. 
  the  suggests a slightly more rigorous justification to wang et al.'s work from 2007, and introduces the slanted line integral. 
  a cyclic n-gonal surface is a compact riemann surface x of genus g\geq 2 admitting a cyclic group of conformal automorphisms c of order n such that the quotient space xc has genus 0. in this , we provide an overview of ongoing research into automorphism groups of cyclic n-gonal surfaces. much of the  is expository or will appear in forthcoming s, so proofs are usually omitted. numerous explicit examples are presented illustrating the computational methods currently being used to study these surfaces. 
  the nuclear physics input used to compute the monte carlo reaction rates and probability density functions that are tabulated in the second  of this series ( ii) is presented. specifically, we publish the input files to the monte carlo reaction rate code ratesmc, which is based on the formalism presented in the first  of this series ( i). this data base contains overwhelmingly experimental nuclear physics information. the survey of literature for this review was concluded in november 2009. 
  in this , we will prove that the 2-category (2-sgp) of symmetric 2-groups and 2-category (\cr-2-mod) of \cr-2-modules(\cite{5}) have enough projective objects, respectively. 
  in this , we will construct the injective resolution of any \cr-2-module, define the right derived 2-functor, and give some related properties of the derived 2-functor in (\cr-2-mod). 
  this  presents a hybrid godunov method for three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics. the multidimensional technique outlined in this  is an extension of the one-dimensional method that was developed by sekora &amp; stone 2009, 2010. the earlier one-dimensional technique was shown to preserve certain asymptotic limits and be uniformly well behaved from the photon free streaming (hyperbolic) limit through the weak equilibrium diffusion (parabolic) limit and to the strong equilibrium diffusion (hyperbolic) limit. this  gives the algorithmic details for constructing a multidimensional method. a future  will present numerical tests that demonstrate the robustness of the computational technique across a wide-range of parameter space. 
  this  is the first in series of four s that present an analytical approach to war using game theory. we try to explore why is it that "true peace" can't be achieved and all or any efforts we make towards that goal will have huge road-blocks. a fairly simplistic and non technical overview of our approach is given in this  using prisoner's dilemma. 
  this  is devoted to a dispersion analysis of a class of perturbed p-laplacians. besides the p-laplacian-like eigenvalue problems we also deal with new and non-standard eigenvalue problems, which can not be solved by the methods used in nonlinear eigenvalue problems for p-laplacians and similar operators. original techniques are suggested for solving these new problems (see section 3). in addition, dispersion relations between the eigen-parameters, quantitative analysis of eigenvectors and variational principles for eigenvalues of perturbed p-laplacians are also studied in this . the problems, we study in this  arise from the real world problems. 
  the second bianchi identity can be recast as an evolution equation for the riemann curvatures. here we will  on such a system for a vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetime. this is the first of two s. in the following  we will extend the ideas developed here to general vacuum spacetimes. in this  we will demonstrate our ideas on a schwarzschild spacetime and give detailed numerical results. for suitable choices of lapse function we find that the system gives excellent results with long term stability. 
  in this note we prove that a recent result stated by d.y. gao and r.w. ogden on global minimizers and local extrema in a phase transition problem is false. our goal is achieved by providing a thorough analysis of the context and result in question and counter-examples. 
  spatial scientometrics has attracted a lot of attention in the very recent past. the visualization methods (density maps) presented in this  allow for an analysis revealing regions of excellence around the world using computer programs that are freely available. based on scopus and web of science data, field-specific and field-overlapping scientific excellence can be identified in broader regions (worldwide or for a specific continent) where high quality s (highly cited s or s published in nature or science) were published. we used a geographic information system to produce our density maps. we also briefly discuss the use of google earth. 
  let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. in this , we obtain the structure theorems for semisimple hopf algebras of dimension 9q^2 over k, where q is a prime number. we also prove that odd-dimensional semisimple hopf algebras over k of dimension less than 600 are of frobenius type. 
  this  has been withdrawn owing a re-arrangement of two previously submitted s. the new version of the theoretical work on the triaxial shape of dark matter haloes can be found at the arxiv astro-ph list (co) as article 1104.2905 
  in our earlier s we have proposed an analytically solvable model for the two state curve crossing problem which assumes the coupling to be a dirac delta function. it is used to calculate the effect of curve crossing on electronic absorption spectrum and resonance raman excitation profile for the case of harmonic potentials. in this  we have extended our model to deal with the curve crossing induced dissociation cases. our method is used in this  to calculate the effect of curve crossing induced dissociation on electronic absorption spectrum and resonance raman excitation profile. in this , a model consisting of a harmonic oscillator and a morse oscillator, coupled by dirac delta function, is solved. 
  this  considers the structure of uncertain linear systems building on concepts of robust unobservability and possible controllability which were introduced in previous s. the  presents a new geometric characterization of the possibly controllable states. when combined with previous geometric results on robust unobservability, the results of this  lead to a general kalman type de for uncertain linear systems which can be applied to the problem of obtaining reduced order uncertain system models. 
  bornmann and leydesdorff (in press) proposed methods based on web-of-science data to identify field-specific excellence in cities where highly-cited s were published more frequently than can be expected. top performers in output are cities in which authors are located who publish a number of highly-cited s that is statistically significantly higher than can be expected for these cities. using s published between 1989 and 2009 in information science improvements to the methods of bornmann and leydesdorff (in press) are presented and an alternative mapping approach based on the indicator i3 is introduced here. the i3 indicator was introduced by leydesdorff and bornmann (in press). 
  we present a working prototype of youastro (www.youastro.org), a web-based bibtex-compliant reference management software (rms) for astrophysical s in the saonasa ads database. it also includes as a main feature the concept of distributed  comments and ratings. in these , we introduce the main characteristics of the web application, and we will briefly discuss what could be the advantages and drawbacks of such a system being widespread adopted by the astrophysical community for its scientific literature. 
  in this short note we prove by a counter-example that theorem 3.2 in the  "a study on concave optimization via canonical dual function" by j. zhu, s. tao, d. gao is false; moreover, we give a very short proof for theorem 3.1 in the same . 
  in this  we provide a translation of a  by t. levi-civita, published in 1899, about the correspondence between symmetries and conservation laws for hamilton's equations. we discuss the results of this  and their relationship with the more general classical results by e. noether. 
  i discuss albert einstein's 1914 review , "the formal foundation of the general theory of relativity" from two points of view: the main elements in the  that appear to have led to the downfall of the einstein-grossman theory; and the elements that seem to have inspired einstein during october 1915 to reformulate the 1914 einstein-grossmann theory in the form of the november 1915 and the 1916 general theory of relativity. first  among three s.

  this  discusses the application of agile software development methods in software-based research environments. 
  the aim of this note is to emphasize the fact that in many s on invexity published in prestigious journals there are not clear definitions, trivial or not clear statements and wrong proofs. we also point out the unprofessional way of answering readers' questions by some authors. we think that this is caused mainly by the lack of criticism of the invexity community 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors since it was strongly elaborated, some new sections appeared. this made the  significantly differ from current version. besides two new authors participated in the work. so the authors believe that new version of  should be considered as a new submission to appear later. 
  dual-gate electrostatic modulation gives an attractive approach for transistors performance improvement, threshold voltage (vth) and operation mode modulation, which is favorable for chemical sensor and logic applications. here, a self-aligned junctionless semiconducting oxide channels are dual-gate electrostatic modulated by solution-processed chitosan-based proton conductors on  substrates. the low-voltage junctionless  transistors can be effectively tuned from depletion mode to enhancement mode by the second in-plane gate. or logic gate was experimentally demonstrated on such dual-in-plane gate junctionless transistors. such dual-gate organicinorganic hybrid  transistors are promising for portable  electronics. 
  a  for general audience about descriptive inner model theory. 
  one approach to monitoring a dynamic system relies on de of the system into weakly interacting subsystems. an earlier  introduced a notion of weak interaction called separability, and showed that it leads to exact propagation of marginals for prediction. this  addresses two questions left open by the earlier : can we define a notion of approximate separability that occurs naturally in practice, and do separability and approximate separability lead to accurate monitoring? the answer to both questions is afirmative. the  also analyzes the structure of approximately separable des, and provides some explanation as to why these models perform well. 
  in his  "beyond endoscopy," langlands tries to understand functoriality via poles of l-functions. the following  further investigates the analytic continuation of a l-function associated to a gl_2 automorphic form through the trace formula. though the usual way to obtain the analytic continuation of an l-function is through its functional equation, this  shows that by simply assuming the trace formula, the functional equation of the l-function may be recovered. this  is a step towards understanding the analytic continuation of the l-function at the same time as capturing information about functoriality.   from an analytic number theory perspective, obtaining the functional equation from the trace formula implies that voronoi summation should in general be also a consequence of the trace formula. 
  this is a companion draft to  'software clustering: unifying syntactic and semantic features', in proceedings of the 19th working conference on reverse engineering (wcre 2012). it discusses the clustering process in detail, which appeared in the  in an abridged form. it also contains certain additional process steps which were not covered in the wcre . the clustering process is described for applications with java source-code. however, as argued in the wcre , it can be seamlessly adapted to many other programming paradigms. 
  we give an abstract approach to the results of adams and nobel, [1]. it allows to exhibit a new property of vc classes. it should be stressed that the basic ideas of proofs can be found in [1]. 
  in this  we construct a subclass of the composite access structure introduced by mart\'inez et al. based on schemes realizing the structure given by the set of codewords of minimal support of linear codes. this class enlarges the iterated threshold class studied in the same . furthermore all the schemes on this  are ideal (in fact they allow a vector space construction) and we arrived to give a partial answer to a conjecture stated in the above . finally, as a corollary we proof that all the monotone access structures based on all the minimal supports of a code can be realized by a vector space construction. 
  recently we wrote a  on the theory of the quantum spin hall effect(qshe) in two dimensional(2d) topological insulators(tis)1 which have been considered as do not add much new insight to the exhaustively studied topic of ti within a single-electron picture by the referees. in this  we review the s on the mechanism of the qshe which have significant influence on understanding of the subject. by illustrating the failures of the previous works we show our  do contribute a different point of view to this topic, which we believe is not only a new but also the correct way to approach the problem at the single-electron level. 
  we calculate resistance distances between s in a nearly bipartite citation network of 492 s and the sources cited by them. we validate that this is a realistic measure of thematic distance if each citation link has an electric resistance equal to the geometric mean of the number of the 's references and the citation number of the cited source. 
  this  argues, first, that a major problem in the planning of large infrastructure projects is the high level of misinformation about costs and benefits that decision makers face in deciding whether to build, and the high risks such misinformation generates. second, it explores the causes of misinformation and risk, mainly in the guise of optimism bias and strategic misrepresentation. finally, the  presents a number of measures aimed at improving planning and decision making for large infrastructure projects, including changed incentive structures and better planning methods. thus the  is organized as a simple triptych consisting in problems, causes, and cures. 
  we refine the presentation of the previous  of our group, y.ezawa et al., class. quantum grav. {\bf 23} (2006), 3205 [arxiv:gr-qc0507060]. in that , we proposed a canonical formalism of f(r)-type generalized gravity by using the lie derivatives instead of the time derivatives. however, the use of the lie derivatives was not sufficient. in this note, we make use of the lie derivatives as far as possible, so that no time derivatives are used. 
  this  traces the early history of the aharonov-bohm effect. it appears to have been `discovered' at least three times to my knowledge before the defining  of aharonov and bohm appeared in 1959. the first hint of the effect appears in germany in 1939, immediately disappearing from sight in those troubled times. it reappeared in a  in 1949, ten years before the defining  appeared. here i  the background to the early evolution of this effect, presenting first hand unpublished accounts ed to me by colleagues at birkbeck college in the university of london. 
  in karatzas and kardaras's  on semimartingale financial models, it is proved that the nupbr condition is a property of the local characteristic of the asset process alone. in takaoka's  on nupbr, it is proved that the nupbr condition is equivalent to the existence of a simga-martingale deflator. however, takaoka's  founds its proof on delbaen and schachermayer's fundamental asset pricing theorem, i.e. the nflvr condition, which is not a pure property of the local characteristic of the asset process. in this  we give an alternative proof of the result of takaoka, which makes use only the properties of the local characteristic of the asset process. 
  in this , a fault-tolerant control of 2 dof helicopter (trms system) based on h-infinity is presented. in particular, the introductory part of the  presents a fault-tolerant control (ftc), the first part of this  presents a description of the mathematical model of trms, and the last part of the  presented and a polytypic unknown input observer (uio) is synthesized using equalities and lmis. this uio is used to observe the faults and then compensate them, in this part the shown how to design a fault-tolerant control strategy for this particular class of non-linear systems. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors. we consider the attraction-repulsion chemotaxis system (3 complicated pdes system) under homogeneous neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain {\omega} with smooth boundary, then the classical solutions to the system are uniformly-in-time bounded. after the local existence and uniqueness of solutions was proved, some priory estimates and proves will be established for the global existence of solutions (see the complete abstract in the pdf version of ). 
  it is known that random variables have the riesz de property and the interpolation property. these properties are not only interesting in their own rights; they have been applied to quantitative finance and actuarial mathematics. one would naturally ask whether the same holds for stopping times. we give an affirmative answer in this . we also point out that optional times possess these two properties too. 
  keisler proved that if \theta is a strong limit cardinal and \lambda is a singular cardinal, then the transfer relation \theta\longrightarrow\lambda holds. in a previous , we studied initial elementary submodels of the \lambda-like models produced in the proof of keisler's transfer theorem when \theta is further assumed to be regular i.e., \theta is strongly inaccessible. in this  we deal with a much more difficult situation. some years ago ali enayat asked the author whether keisler's singular-like models can have elementary end extensions. we give a positive answer to this question. 
  in this series of two s, we will prove a natural matrix weighted t1 theorem for matrix kernelled czos. in the current , we will prove matrix weighted norm inequalities for matrix symbolled paraproducts via a general matrix weighted carleson embedding theorem. along the way, we will also provide a stopping time proof of the identification of l^p(w) as a weighted triebel-lizorkin space when w is a matrix a{}_p weight. 
  in the literatures, it is well-known that fossorier code has the girth among ldpc codes. in this , we introduce a new class of low-density parity-check (ldpc) codes, with higher girth than other previous constructed codes. especially we proposed a new method to construct ldpc codes using non fixed shift permutation matrices and full based matrices with higher girth than codes constructed by fossorier. 
  in this , i shall demonstrate that sufficiently high-dimensional closed positively-curved riemannian manifolds are either diffeomorphic to a spherical space form, or isometric to a locally compact rank one symmetric space. this surprising classification of positively-curved riemannian manifolds results from combining the concentration of measures of grassmanians with brendle-schoen pointwise (weakly)- 14-pinching theorem. a direct corollary of the main result within this  is the answering of the long standing hopf conjecture in sufficiently high dimensions. 
  this  contains no new results. it is intended to be merely a brief introduction to the long : n. j. kalton, differentials of complex interpolation processes for kothe function spaces. trans. amer. math. soc. 333 (1992), no. 2, 479--529. and to mention some possible directions for applying the powerful methods developed in kalton's  for further future research. the reader should also be aware of other perspectives in other commentaries on kalton's , which appear in other sources to which we refer. 
  this is the first out of two s on independent resolutions for totally disconnected dynamical systems. in the present , we discuss independent resolutions from an algebraic point of view. we also present applications to group homology and cohomology. this first  sets the stage for our second , where we explain how to use independent resolutions in k-theory computations for crossed products attached to totally disconnected dynamical systems. 
  this is a revised version of our  published in journal of convergence information technology(jcit): "comparison of feature point extraction algorithms for vision based autonomous aerial refueling". we corrected some errors including measurement unit errors, spelling errors and so on. since the published s in jcit are not allowed to be modified, we submit the revised version to arxiv.org to make the  more rigorous and not to confuse other researchers. 
  toric origami manifolds are characterized by origami templates, which are combinatorial models built by gluing polytopes together along facets. in this , we examine the topology of orientable toric oigami manifolds with coorientable folding hypersurface. we determine the fundamental group. in our previous  [hp], we studied the ordinary and equivariant cohomology rings of simply connected toric origami manifolds. we conclude this  by computing some betti numbers in the non-simply connected case. 
  the  discusses some uniqueness sets for fourier series. 
  in this  we consider the reproducing kernel thesis for boundedness and compactness for operators on \ell^2--valued bergman-type spaces. this  generalizes many well--known results about classical function spaces to their \ell^2--valued versions. in particular, the results in this  apply to the weighted \ell^2--valued bergman space on the unit ball, the unit polydisc and, more generally to weighted fock spaces. 
  this  gives a concise proof of the jordan curve theorem on discrete surfaces. we also embed the discrete surface in the 2d plane to prove the original version of the jordan curve theorem. this  is a simple version of l. chen, note on the discrete jordan curve theorem (revised version), arxiv:1312.0316. we seek to clarify and simplify some statements and proofs. again, the purpose of this  is to make the proof of the theorems easier to understand. in this revision, we added another appendix to make a self-contained proof on verifying simple connectedness of the euclidean plane in this . 
  in this short  we give an overview of woodin's surgery method. 
  in this , we give identities involving cyclic sums of regularized multiple zeta values of depth less than 5. as a corollary, we present two kinds of extensions of hoffman's theorem for symmetric sums of multiple zeta values for this case. 
  in this  we study properties of some sums of members of the sequence \{z[t_\nu(\tau)]\}. our results are expressed in statements proving essential influence of the lindel\" of hypothesis on corresponding formulae. in this : the parts 1 -- 6 are english version of our  \cite{6}, and the part 7 of this work contains current results, namely new set of metamorphosis of the main multiform from our  \cite{7}. 
  in a beautiful  deligne and illusie proved the degeneration of the hodge-to-de rham spectral sequence using positive characteristic methods. in a recent  arinkin, c\u{a}ld\u{a}raru and the author of this  gave a geometric interpretation of the problem of deligne-illusie showing that the triviality of a certain line bundle on a derived scheme implies the the deligne-illusie result. in the present  we generalize these ideas to logarithmic schemes and using the theory of twisted derived intersection of logarithmic schemes we obtain the hodge theorem for the logarithmic de rham complex. 
  this  presents new stability results for matrix wiener--hopf factorisation. the first part of the  examines conditions for stability of wiener-hopf factorisation in daniele--khrapkov class. the second part of the  concerns the class of matrix functions which can be exactly or approximately reduced to the factorisation of the daniele--khrapkov matrices. the results of the  are demonstrated by numerical examples with partial indices \(\{1,-1\}\), \(\{0,0\}\) and \(\{-1,-1\}\). 
  this  continues the series of s that develop a new approach to syntax and semantics of dependent type theories. here we study the interpretation of the rules of the identity types in the intensional martin-lof type theories on the c-systems that arise from universe categories. in the first part of the  we develop constructions that produce interpretations of these rules from certain structures on universe categories while in the second we study the functoriality of these constructions with respect to functors of universe categories. the results of the first part of the  play a crucial role in the construction of the univalent model of type theory in simplicial sets. 
  this  attempts to situate statistics in relation to qualitative research methods and other means of "finding out". it compares and contrasts aspects of qualitative research methods and statistical inquiry and attempts to answer the question of whether and how elements of qualitative research methods should be included in statistics teaching. 
  in this exploration , we design algorithms for deforming and contracting a simply connected discrete closed manifold to a discrete sphere. such a contraction is a kind of shrinking or reducing process. in our algorithms, we need to assume an ambient space for the discrete manifold, and this ambient space also a simply connected discrete space in higher dimensions.   our algorithm would work for most of cases. for some special cases, we will make detailed analysis in the next . in other words, this  has not provided a complete proof for each case. the algorithm designed in this  is in polynomial time. 
  this is the preprint version of our  on iconip. outdoor augmented reality geographic information system (argis) is the hot application of augmented reality over recent years. this  concludes the key solutions of argis, designs the mobile augmented reality pipeline prospect system (arpps), and respectively realizes the machine vision based pipeline prospect system (mvbpps) and the sensor based pipeline prospect system (sbpps). with the mvbpps's realization, this  studies the neural network based 3d features matching method. 
  this is the preprint version of our  on rehab2015. this  proposed a novel immersive entertainment system for the users of hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber. the system is a hybrid of hardware and software, the scheme is described in this . the hardware is combined by a hmd (i.e. virtual reality glasses shell), a smartphone and a waterproof bag. the software is able to transfer the stereoscopic images of the 3d game to the screen of the smartphone synchronously. the comparison and selection of the hardware are discussed according to the practical running scene of the clinical hyperbaric oxygen treatment. finally, a preliminary guideline for designing this kind of system is raised accordingly. 
  do highly productive researchers have significantly higher probability to produce top cited s? or does the increased productivity in science only result in a sea of irrelevant s as a perverse effect of competition and the increased use of indicators for research evaluation and accountability focus? we use a swedish author disambiguated data set consisting of 48,000 researchers and their wos-publications during the period of 2008 2011 with citations until 2014 to investigate the relation between productivity and production of highly cited s. as the analysis shows, quantity does make a difference. 
  in this , we study the dual problem of the expected utility maximization in incomplete markets with bounded random endowment. we start with the problem formulated in the  of cvitani\'{c}-schachermayer-wang (2001) and prove the following statement: in the brownian framework, the countably additive part q^r of the dual optimizer q\in (l^\infty)^* obtained in that  can be represented by the terminal value of a supermartingale deflator y defined in the  of kramkov-schachermayer (1999), which is a local martingale. 
  a map from a manifold to a euclidean space is said to be k-regular if the image of any distinct k points are linearly independent. in this , we give some lower bounds of the dimension of the ambient euclidean space for complex k-regular maps on euclidean spaces. 
  this  extends a previous bound of order o(n^{-1}) of the authors (arxiv:1405.7820[math.pr]), for the rate of convergence in kolmogorov distance of the expected spectral distribution of a wigner random matrix ensemble to the semicircular law. here we relax the moment conditions for entries of the wigner matrices from order 8 to order 4+ \epsilon for an arbitrary small \epsilon&gt;0. 
  we prove linear independence of indefinite iterated eisenstein integrals over the fraction field of the ring of formal power series \mathbb{z}[[q]]. our proof relies on a general criterium for linear independence of iterated integrals, which has been established by deneufch{\^a}tel, duchamp, minh and solomon. as a corollary, we obtain \mathbb{c}-linear independence of indefinite iterated eisenstein integrals, which has applications to the study of elliptic multiple zeta values, as defined by enriquez. 
  the author has consulted with us to withdraw this version from arxiv, and we both reach a consensus agreement. so we would like withdraw this  from arxiv. for the detail of this  and following update, one can refer to arxiv:1802.09942, which is uploaded by the author himself. 
  this  is an extension to an early presented programming language, called a domain specific language. this  extends the proposed concept with new sensors and behaviours to address real-life situations. the functionality was tested in lab experiments, and an extension to the earlier concepts is proposed. 
  we comment on the  \"uber extremalprobleme der konformen geometrie (on extremal problems in conformal geometry) by teichm\"uller, published in 1941. this  contains ideas on a wide generalization of his previous work on the solution of extremal problems in conformal geometry. the generalization concerns at the same time the fields of function theory, topology and algebra. the final version of this  will appear as a chapter in volume vi of the handbook of teichm\"uller theory. this volume is dedicated to the memory of alexander grothendieck. 
  we comment on teichm{\"u}ller 's  ''vollst{\"a}ndige l{\"o}sung einer extremalaufgabe der quasikonformen abbildung'' (complete solution of an ex-tremal problem of the quasiconformal mapping),, published in 1941. in this , teichm{\"u}ller gives a proof of the existence of extremal quasiconformal mappings in the case of the pentagon (disc with five distinguished points on the boundary). the final version of this  will appear as a chapter in volume vi of the handbook of teichm{\"u}ller theory. 
  this  is a continuation of a previous . here, as there, we examine the problem of finding the maximum number of terms in a partial sequence of distinct unit fractions larger than 1100 that sums to 1. in the previous , we found that the maximum number of terms is 42 and introduced a method for showing that. in this , we demonstrate that there are 27 possible solutions with 42 terms, and discuss how primes show that no 43-term solution exists. 
  in a recent  [j. combin. theory ser. b}, 113 (2015), pp. 1-17], the authors have extended the concept of quadrangulation of a surface to higher dimension, and showed that every quadrangulation of the n-dimensional projective space p^n is at least (n+2)-chromatic, unless it is bipartite. they conjectured that for any integers k\geq 1 and n\geq 2k+1, the schrijver graph sg(n,k) contains a spanning subgraph which is a quadrangulation of p^{n-2k}. the purpose of this  is to prove the conjecture. 
  this  treat determinacy of strong moment problems in part i and indeterminacy of strong moment problems in part ii. this  is a summary of the following s:   [1] ald\'en. e., determinacy of strong moment problems. [2] on indeterminacy of strong moment problems. [3] indeterminacy of strong moment problems.   this  will treat determinacyindeterminacy of the strong stieltjes and hamburger moment problems, part i. indeterminacy, part ii, for certain class of distribution functions. we conclude by proving a theorem for indeterminacy of the strong problems above for general distribution functions. 
  as indicated in the title, this  was inspired by smithson's work on arzel\`a-ascoli theorem. up to this point, the author's interest in the topic has led him to generalize arzel\`a-ascoli theorem in the context of uniform spaces. this approach was primarily influenced by j.l. kelley's \textit{general topology}. soon after, the author learnt that in 1971, r.e. smithson carried over kelley's approach to the case of point-compact multifunctions (rather than single-valued functions). similarly, in this  the author would like to carry over the result, presented in his previous  \textit{arzel\`a-ascoli theorem in uniform spaces}, to the case of point-compact multifunctions. 
  we derive intrinsic curvature and radius estimates for compact disks embedded in \mathbb{r}^3 with nonzero constant mean curvature and apply these estimates to study the global geometry of complete surfaces embedded in \mathbb{r}^3 with nonzero constant mean curvature. 
  the national cybersecurity center of excellence (nccoe) (in the united states) has published on october 19, 2015, a white  on "privacy-enhanced identity brokers." we present here a reply to their request for public comments. we enumerate concerns whose consideration we find paramount for the design of a privacy-enhancing identity brokering solution, for identification and authentication of citizens into myriad online services, and we recommend how to incorporate them into a revised white . our observations, focused on privacy, security, auditability and forensics, are mostly based on a recently published research  (pets 2015) about two nation-scale brokered identification systems. 
  the oscoss project (opening scholarly communication in social sciences), which will be outlined, aims at providing integrated support for all steps of the scholarly communication process. incl. collaborative writing of a scientific , collecting data related to existing publications, interpreting and including data in a , submitting the  for peer review, reviewing the , publishing an article, and, finally, facilitating its consumption by readers. the oscoss project will support this process considering in particular the perspective of three main actors detailed in the use case descriptions below: readers, authors and reviewers. 
  pp(top x%) is the proportion of s of a unit (e.g. an institution or a group of researchers), which belongs to the x% most frequently cited s in the corresponding fields and publication years. it has been proposed that x% of s can be expected which belongs to the x% most frequently cited s. in this letter to the editor we will present the results of an empirical test whether we can really have this expectation and how strong the deviations from the expected values are when many random samples are drawn from the database. 
  this  is the first of a series of introductory s on the fascinating world of soergel bimodules. it is combinatorial in nature and should be accessible to a broad audience. the objective of this  is to help the reader feel comfortable calculating with soergel bimodules and to explain some of the important open problems in the field. the motivations, history and relations to other fields will be developed in subsequent s of this series. 
  in program algebra, an algebraic theory of single-pass instruction sequences, three congruences on instruction sequences are paid attention to: instruction sequence congruence, structural congruence, and behavioural congruence. sound and complete axiom systems for the first two congruences were already given in early s on program algebra. the current  is the first one that is concerned with an axiom system for the third congruence. the presented axiom system is especially notable for its axioms that have to do with forward jump instructions. 
  this  presents a survey of some new applications of algebraic riccati equations. in particular, the  surveys some recent results on the use of algebraic riccati equations in testing whether a system is negative imaginary and in synthesizing state feedback controllers which make the closed loop system negative imaginary. the  also surveys the use of riccati equation methods in the control of quantum linear systems including coherent h^\infty control. 
  this  is a continuation of the author's preceding one. in the preceding  the author has rigorously constructed the feynman path integral for the dirac equation in the form of the sum-over-histories, satisfying the superposition principle, over all paths of one electron in space-time that goes in any direction at any speed, forward and backward in time with a finite number of turns. in the present , first we will generalize the results in the preceding  and secondly prove in a direct way that our feynman path integral satisfies the unitarity principle and the causality one. 
  this  is in response to a recent comment by bellissard [arxiv:1704.02644] on the  [phys. rev. lett. 118, 130201 (2017)]. it is explained that the issues raised in the comment have already been discussed in the  and do not affect the conclusions of the . 
  the development of stretchable and flexible electronics based on soft polymeric substrates requires novel approaches in the design, fabrication, integration, and packaging of passive and active electronic components. here we demonstrate the fabrication, based on the use of supersonic cluster beam implantation and deposition, of a system consisting of a stretchable keyboard made by pdms connected with a touch sensor and a matrix of leds printed on , through -based interconnections. the stretchable keyboard has conductive vias to electrically connect the top and bottom layers. gold conductive films printed on  are used to connect the keyboard with the electronic components that drive the led matrix.

  in this  i will present a short scientific biography of guido altarelli, briefly describing some of his most important seminal works. i will analyze in great details the  of the q^2 evolution of the effective quark distribution: i will put this  in a historical perspective, describing our theoretical understanding at that time and the reasons why the  was so successful. 
  we present etymo (https:etymo.io), a discovery engine to facilitate artificial intelligence (ai) research and development. it aims to help readers navigate a large number of ai-related s published every week by using a novel form of search that finds relevant s and displays related s in a graphical interface. etymo constructs and maintains an adaptive similarity-based network of research s as an all-purpose knowledge graph for ranking, recommendation, and visualisation. the network is constantly evolving and can learn from user feedback to adjust itself. 
  this  generalizes huang's cohomology theory of grading-restricted vertex algebras to meromorphic open-string vertex algebras (mosvas hereafter), which are noncommutative generalizations of grading-restricted vertex algebras introduced by huang. the vertex operators for these algebras satisfy associativity but do not necessarily satisfy the commutativity. moreover, the mosva and its bimodules considered in this  do not necessarily have finite-dimensional homogeneous subspaces, though we do require that they have lower-bounded gradings. the construction and results in this  will be used in a joint  by huang and the author to give a cohomological criterion of the reductivity for modules for grading-restricted vertex algebras 
  we described a decentralized distributed deterministic asynchronous dykstra's algorithm that allows for time-varying graphs in an earlier . in this , we show how to incorporate subdifferentiable functions into the framework using a step similar to the bundle method. we point out that our algorithm also allows for partial data communications. we discuss a standard step for treating the  of a convex and linear function. 
  this  revisits the controversy concerning whether gravitational lensing effects make a significant difference to estimation of distance to the cosmic microwave background last scattering surface in cosmology. a recent  by kaiser and peacock supports a previous  by weinberg stating that such affects average to zero because of energy conservation. in this note, problems are pointed out in the kaiser and peacock analysis related to their choice of endpoint of integration, and to the `wrinkly surface' argument. 
  two short seminal s of margulis used kazhdan's property (t) to give, on the one hand, explicit constructions of expander graphs, and to prove, on the other hand, the uniqueness of some invariant means on compact simple lie groups. these s opened a rich line of research on expansion and spectral gap phenomena in finite and compact simple groups. in this  we survey the history of this area and point out a number of problems which are still open. 
  in this  c-slow retiming (csr) on rtl is discussed. csr multiplies the functionality of cores by adding the same number of registers into each path. the technique is ideal for fpgas with their already existing registers. previously publications are limited to adding registers on netlist level, which generates a lot of system verification problems and which is assumed to be the major drawback to use this technology in the modern multicore times. the  shows how csr can efficiently be done with timing driven automatic rtl modification. the methodology provided with this  can be used as guidance for using csr in high level synthesis (hls). the  shows the results of a csr-ed complex risc core on rtl implemented on fpgas. 
  in this , we study efficient domination in regular graphs. 
  this  presents a review of the literature on state estimation (se) in power systems. while covering some works related to se in transmission systems, the main focus of this  is distribution system state estimation (dsse). the  discusses a few critical topics of dsse, including mathematical problem formulation, application of pseudo-measurements, metering instrument placement, network topology issues, impacts of renewable penetration, and cyber-security. both conventional and modern data-driven and probabilistic techniques have been reviewed. this  can provide researchers and utility engineers with insights into the technical achievements, barriers, and future research directions of dsse. 
  in the  of gohar m. kyureghyan and alexander pott (designs, codes and cryptography, 29, 149-164, 2003), the linear feedback polynomials of the sidel'nikov-lempel-cohn-eastman sequences were determined for some special cases. when referring to that , we found that corollary 4 and theorem 2 of that  are wrong because there exist many counterexamples for these two results. in this note, we give some counterexamples of corollary 4 and theorem 2 of that .

  we tried to show in this  that ch implies: there is a homogeneous family of subset of omega which is maximal with respect to inclusion. the  is currently "withdrawn", since a mistake has been discovered. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors, due a crucial error. 
  the web page contains both the dvi and postscript version of the . this  presents the method of applying the melnikov method to autonomous hamiltonian systems in dimension four. besides giving an application to celestial mechanics, it discusses the problem of convergence of the melnikov function and the derivative of the melnikov function.

  recently o. sarig has introduced and explored the concept of positively recurrent functions. in this  we construct a natural wide class of such functions and we showthat they have stronger ergodic properties than the general functions considered in sarig's . 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author, due an error in the proof of proposion 2.13. 
  we give a representation-theoretic proof of the formula for correlation functions of z-measures obtained by borodin and olshanski in math.rt9904010. this  is historically preceding my  math.rt9907127. 
  the  was withdrawn due to a gap in the proof of lemma 3. 
  the  has been withdrawn because the result of math.qa0002057 "deformation quantization with traces" holds only for a constant volume form. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the authors, due to a mistake pointed out by lenny ng and josh sabloff.

  this is an erratum to the : compact hyperkaehler manifolds: basic results. (alg-geom9705025, inv. math. 135). we give a correct proof of the projectivity criterion for hyperkaehler manifolds. we use a recent result of demailly and paun math.ag0105176. 
  in this  we prove the 2-local part of the beilinson-lichtenbaum conjectures on tosion in motivic cohomology. in particular we prove the milnor conjecture relating milnor's k-theory and the galois cohomology with z2-coefficients. this  is a new version of the previously distributed preprint "the milnor conjecture". 
  this  can be considered as an extension to our  [on symplectically harmonic forms on six-dimensional nilmanifolds, comment. math. helv. 76 (2001), n 1, 89-109]. also, it contains a brief survey of recent results on symplectically harmonic cohomology. 
  this text is a draft of the review  on projectively dual varieties. topics include dual varieties, pyasetskii pairing, discriminant complexes, resultants and schemes of zeros, secant and tangential varieties, ein theorems, applications of projective differential geometry and mori theory to dual varieties, degree and multiplicities of discriminants, self-dual varieties, etc. 
  an algorithm is given to compute a normal form for hyperelliptic curves. the elliptic case has been treated in a previous . in this  the hyperelliptic case is treated. 
   is withdrawn due to errors (superseded by math.ag0604303). formula 6.5 is false. section 6 is false, and the main statement is true only for bundles b with c_1(b) su(2)-invariant.
