  we have experimentally investigated the fracture process in  samples submitted to a uniaxial force. five types of  sheets (newsprint, towel, sulfite, silk and couche s) were fractured along two orthogonal orientations. in order to characterize the rupture lines of the  sheets we utilized the hurst exponent. our results indicate a dependence of the hurst exponent on the orientation of the  sheets for samples of newsprint and, probably, towel and silk s. for the other types of  the hurst exponent does not depend on the direction of crack propagation.

  as more and more academic s are being submitted to conferences and journals, evaluating all these s by professionals is time-consuming and can cause inequality due to the personal factors of the reviewers. in this , in order to assist professionals in evaluating academic s, we propose a novel task: automatic academic  rating (aapr), which automatically determine whether to accept academic s. we build a new dataset for this task and propose a novel modularized hierarchical convolutional neural network to achieve automatic academic  rating. evaluation results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines by a large margin. the dataset and code are available at \url{https:github.comlancopkuaapr}

  naively, one would expect longer s to have larger impact (i.e., to be cited more). i tested this expectation by selecting all (~30,000) refereed s from a&amp;a, aj, apj and mnras published between 2000 and 2004. these particular years were chosen so s analyzed would not be too "fresh", but at the same time length of each article could be obtained via ads. i find that indeed longer s published in these four major astronomy journals are on average cited more, with a median number of citations increasing from 6 for articles 2-3 pages long to about 50 for articles ~50 pages long. i do however observe a significant "letters effect", i.e. apj and a&amp;a articles 4 pages long are cited more than articles 5-10 pages long. also, the very few longest (&gt;80 pages) s are actually cited less than somewhat shorter s. for individual journals, median citations per  increase from 11 for ~9,300 a&amp;a s to 14 for ~5,300 mnras s, 16 for ~2,550 aj s, and 20 for ~12,850 apj s (including apj letters and supplement). i conclude with some semi-humorous career advice, directed especially at first-year graduate students. 
  this  has been withdrawn by the author because the result of this  was already obtained. 
  traditionally, the number of citations that a scholarly  receives from other s is used as the proxy of its scientific impact. yet citations can come from domains outside the scientific community, and one such example is through patented technologies--- can be cited by patents, achieving technological impact. while the scientific impact of s has been extensively studied, the technological aspect remains less known in the literature. here we aim to fill this gap by presenting a comparative study on how 919 thousand biomedical s are cited by u.s. patents and by other s over time. we observe a positive correlation between citations from patents and from s, but there is little overlap between the two domains in either the most cited s, or s with the most delayed recognition. we also find that the two types of citations exhibit distinct temporal variations, with patent citations lagging behind  citations for a median of 6 years for the majority of s. our work contributes to the understanding of the technological impact of s. 
  following my previous study of  length vs. number of citations in astronomy (stanek 2008), some colleagues expressed an interest in knowing if any correlation exists between citations and the number of authors on an astronomical . at least naively, one would expect s with more authors to be cited more. i test this expectation with the same sample of s as analyzed in stanek (2008), selecting all (~30,000) refereed s from a&amp;a, aj, apj and mnras published between 2000 and 2004. (...) i find that indeed s with more authors are on average cited more, but only weakly so: roughly, the number of citations doubles with ten-fold increase in the number of authors. while the median number of citations to a 2 author  is 17, the median number of citations to a  with 10 to 20 authors is 32. i find that most of the s are written by a small number of authors, with a mode of 2 authors and a median of 3 authors. i also find that s with more authors are not longer than s with fewer authors, in fact a median number of 8 to 10 pages per  holds for any number of authors. for the same sample of s, a median number of citations per  grew from 15 in june 2008 (stanek 2008) to 19 in november 2009. unlike stanek (2008), i do not conclude with any career advice, semi-humorous or otherwise. 
  wigner's 1939  on representations of the inhomogeneous lorentz group is one of the most fundamental s in physics. wigner maintained his passion for this subject throughout his life. in this , i will review the s which he published with me on this subject. these s deal with the question of unifying the internal space-time symmetries of massive and massless particles.

  in this  we give a proof of the existence of global regular solutions to the fourier transformed navier-stokes system with small initial data in \phi(2) via an iteration argument. the proof of the regularity theorem is a minor modification of the proof given in the  "some elementary estimates for the navier-stokes system". so this  is intended to be just a complement to the afore mentioned . 
  since the publication of robert k. merton's theory of cumulative advantage in science (matthew effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its presence at the level of s, individual researchers, institutions or countries. however, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic "quality" of s or of researchers--"better" (however defined) s or researchers could receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. using an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of s--identical duplicate s published in different journals with different impact factors--this  shows that the journal in which s are published have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate s published in high impact journals obtain, on average, twice as much citations as their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact factors. the intrinsic value of a  is thus not the only reason a given  gets cited or not; there is a specific matthew effect attached to journals and this gives to  published there an added value over and above their intrinsic quality. 
  the author decided to withdraw this  by 1) an error in lemma 5.11 (and 5.12) which requires some justification; 2) the main result of this  suffers overlap with arxiv:1203.5254; 3) the author decided to split arxiv:1203.5254 into two pieces, and the main application of this  is transferred to one of them (in order to keep strength of the applications presented in each ); and 4) thus a "newer version" of this  would have different story and substantially different contents, which he feels a different . 
  this  starts from the configuration space of a degree-4 single-vertex creased , and develops a sufficient and necessary condition for a quadrilateral creased  to be rigid-foldable. by introducing two more useful sufficient conditions that only depend on the sector angles, we are able to generate two families of rigid-foldable quadrilateral creased s. all such creased s have one degree of freedom in each branch of their rigid folding motion. for each family of quadrilateral creased  the total design freedoms and possible rigid folding motions are analyzed. 
  as the number of people who use scientific literature databases grows, the demand for literature retrieval services has been steadily increased. one of the most popular retrieval services is to find a set of s similar to the  under consideration, which requires a measure that computes similarities between s. scientific literature databases exhibit two interesting characteristics that are different from general databases. first, the s cited by old s are often not included in the database due to technical and economic reasons. second, since a  references the s published before it, few s cite recently-published s. these two characteristics cause all existing similarity measures to fail in at least one of the following cases: (1) measuring the similarity between old, but similar s, (2) measuring the similarity between recent, but similar s, and (3) measuring the similarity between two similar s: one old, the other recent. in this , we propose a new link-based similarity measure called c-rank, which uses both in-link and out-link by disregarding the direction of references. in addition, we discuss the most suitable normalization method for scientific literature databases and propose an evaluation method for measuring the accuracy of similarity measures. we have used a database with real-world s from dblp and their reference information crawled from libra for experiments and compared the performance of c-rank with those of existing similarity measures. experimental results show that c-rank achieves a higher accuracy than existing similarity measures. 
  a variety of  were drawn by lead pencil with the grade between 4h through 10b. raman spectroscopy verified both g and d peaks on all the drawing on pc print , pc photo , kent  and  for silver halide print. after irradiation of scanning femtosecond laser, silver halide  drawn with 10b lead pencil remained surface flatness compared to the other s. raman spectroscopy on silver print  showed a large g peak with less intensity of d peak. after irradiation of scanning femtosecond laser on silver halide  drawn by 10b lead pencil, raman spectroscopy showed large g peak and less intensity of d peak together with 2d peak around 2,700 cm corresponding to the existence of multi graphene. 
  we present an analysis of the s published in the journals nature and science in the years from 2006 to 2010. during this period, a total of 7788 s were published in the two journals. this includes 544 astronomy s that comprise 7.0% of the s in `all' research fields and 18.9% of those in the fields of `physical sciences'. the sub-fields of research of the astronomy s are distributed, in descending order of number of s, in solar system, stellar astronomy, galaxies and the universe, the milky way galaxy, and exoplanets. the observational facilities used for the studies are mainly ground-based telescopes (31.1%), spacecrafts (27.0%), and space telescopes (22.8%), while 16.0% of s did not use any noticeable facilities and 1.7% used other facilities. korean scientists have published 86 s (33 in nature and 53 in science), which is 1.10% of all the s (n=7788) in the two journals. the share of s by korean astronomers among the scientific s by koreans is 8.14%, slightly higher than the contribution of astronomy s (7.0%) in both journals.

  this  is a natural continuation of  "on rectifiable spaces and its algebraical equivalents, topological algebraic systems and mal'cev algebras" published in arxiv:1309.4572. thus we justify the need to present the entire material in an unified manner. this  is the continuation of section 6 from the first . it specifies and corrects the roughest mistakes, incorrect statements and nonsense of the introduced concepts, which are available in numerous s on topological algebraic systems, basically in s of academician choban m. m. and his disciples. 
  evaluating and comparing the academic performance of a journal, a researcher or a single  has long remained a critical, necessary but also controversial issue. most of existing metrics invalidate comparison across different fields of science or even between different types of s in the same field. this  proposes a new metric, called return on citation (roc), which is simply a citation ratio but applies to evaluating the , the journal and the researcher in a consistent way, allowing comparison across different fields of science and between different types of s and discouraging unnecessary and coerciveself-citation. 
  a directed curve is a possibly singular curve with well-defined tangent lines along the curve. then the tangent surface to a directed curve is naturally defined as the ruled surface by tangent geodesics to the curve, whenever any affine connection is endowed with the ambient space. in this  the local diffeomorphism classification is completed for generic directed curves. then it turns out that the swallowtails and open swallowtails appear generically for the classification on singularities of tangent surfaces. 
  the scientific  output of the united nations university (unu) was bibliometrically analysed.it was found that (i) a noticeable continous  output starts in 1995, (ii) about 65% of the research s have been published as international cooperations and 18% as single-authored s, (iv) the research s rank above world average according to pudovkin-garfield percentile rank index, and (v)  content indicate the wide variety of scientific topics unu has been and is working on. 
  in research evaluation of single researchers, the assessment of  and journal impact is of interest. high journal impact reflects the ability of researchers to convince strict reviewers, and high  impact reflects the usefulness of s for future research. in many bibliometric studies, metrics for journal and  impact are separately presented. in this , we introduce two graph types, which combine both metrics in a single graph. the graphs can be used in research evaluation to visualize the performance of single researchers comprehensively. 
  this  was written in 2015, and published in the journal of humanistic mathematics. this  announces the first issue (2015) of enchiridion: mathematics user's guides, a project to produce peer-reviewed user's guides as companions to published s. these user's guides are meant to explain the key insights and organizing principles in their companion s, the metaphors and imagery used by the authors, the story of the development of the companion s, and a colloquial summary appropriate for a non-mathematical audience. examples of user's guides can be found at https:mathusersguides.com

  the rock--scissors game, commonly played in east asia, gives a simple model to understand physical, biological, psychological and other problems. the interacting rock--scissors particle system is a point of contact between the kinetic theory of gases by maxwell and boltzmann ( collision model) and the coagulation theory by smoluchowski ( coalescence model). a 2s+1 types extended rock--scissors collision model naturally introduces a nonlinear integrable system. the time evolution of the 2s+1 types extended rock--scissors coalescence model is obtained from the logarithmic time change of the nonlinear integrable system. we also discuss the behavior of a discrete rock--scissors coalescence model.

  as the subject of research excellence has received increasing attention (in science policy) over the last few decades, increasing numbers of bibliometric studies have been published dealing with excellent s. however, many different methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent s. the present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out in order to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an "average" or "most frequent" bibliometric practice. the search in the web of science yielded 321 s dealing with "highly cited", "most cited", "top cited" and "most frequently cited". of the 321 s, 16 could not be used in this study. in around 80% of the s analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition has been provided with which to identify excellent s. with definitions which relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited s (58%) or s with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). around 23% worked with percentile rank classes. over these s, there is an arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3% (median). the top 1% is used most frequently in the s, followed by the top 10%. with the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be possible to identify excellent s based on an "average" or "most frequent" practice among bibliometricians.
