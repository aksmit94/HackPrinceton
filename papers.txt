  measurements on the isotopic and elemental compositions of meteorites, planets, lunar samples, the solar wind, and solar flares since 1960 suggest that the standard solar model may be in error. a new solar model suggests that the observed number of solar neutrinos represents at least 87% of the number generated: there is little if any deficit of solar neutrinos. 
  the relativistic corrections to the maxwellian velocity distribution are needed for standard solar models. relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution, if adopted in standard solar models, will lower solar neutrino fluxes and change solar neutrino energy spectra but keep solar sound speeds. it is possibly a solution to the solar neutrino problem. 
  time profiles of solar soft x-ray microflares and structure soft x-ray solar corona thermal background are studied on rhessi data. the observations of 2003 year are analyzed. decrease fluxe of solar soft x-ray microflares and thermal background of solar corona in the x-ray range 2-15 kev are revealed. the new model of solar corona heating in based on this new data are suggested. 
  quantitative data on the solar wind, solar magnetic fields, solar eruptions, solar neutrinos, and on the planetary material orbiting the sun all indicate the presence of an iron-rich solar interior and a neutron star at the core of the sun. solar magnetic fields are deep-seated remnants from the core andor bose-einstein condensation of fe-rich material into a rotating superconductor. neutron emission from the core triggers a series of reactions that produce solar luminosity, the h carrier gas that maintains mass separation in the sun, and an outpouring of 3 e43 h+ ions per year in the solar wind. 
  we describe a simple method to study the dependence of the solar properties on a generic (small) modification the physical inputs adopted in standard solar models calculations. 
  using data from the global oscillation network group (gong) covering the period from 1995 to 1998, we study the change with solar activity in solar f-mode frequencies. the results are compared with similar changes detected from the michelson doppler imager (mdi) data. we find variations in f-mode frequencies which are correlated with solar activity indices. if these changes are due to variation in solar radius then the implications are that the solar radius decreases by about 5 km from minimum to maximum activity. 
  existing solar energy application systems use small fraction of full spectrum of solar energy. so attempts are made to show how full spectrum solar energy can be used for diffused and beamed form of incident solar energy. luminescent solar concentrator (lsc) principle with optical fibre in diffused sun light and dielectric mirror separation technique with optical fibre in beamed form are discussed. comparison of both the cases are done.   keywords: full spectrum, solar photonics, diffused solar energy, beamed solar energy, lsc, dielectric mirror, optical fibre, photo-voltaic 
  the sun as an oscillator produces frequencies which propagate in the heliosphere, via solar wind, to the terrestrial magnetosphere. we searched for those frequencies in the parameters of the near earth solar plasma and the geomagnetic indices for the past four solar cycles. the solar wind parameters used in this work are the interplanetary magnetic field, plasma beta, alfven mach number, solar wind speed, plasma temperature, plasma pressure, plasma density and the geomagnetic indices dst, ae, ap and kp. we found out that each parameter of the solar wind exhibit certain periodicities which differentiate in each cycle. our results indicate intermittent periodicities in our data, some of them shared between the solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices. 
  detailed solar angular momentum (am) graphs produced from the jet propulsion laboratory (jpl) de405 ephemeris display cyclic perturbations that show a very strong correlation with prior solar activity slowdowns. these same am perturbations also occur simultaneously with known solar path changes about the solar system barycentre (ssb). the am perturbations can be measured and quantified allowing analysis of past solar cycle modulations along with the 11,500 year solar proxy records (14c &amp; 10be). the detailed am information also displays a recurring wave of modulation that aligns very closely with the observed sunspot record since 1650. the am perturbation and modulation is a direct product of the outer gas giants (uranus &amp; neptune). this information gives the opportunity to predict future grand minima along with normal solar cycle strength with some confidence. a proposed mechanical link between solar activity and planetary influence via a discrepancy found in solarplanet am along with current am perturbations indicate solar cycle 24 &amp; 25 will be heavily reduced in sunspot activity resembling a similar pattern to solar cycles 5 &amp; 6 during the dalton minimum (1790-1830). 
  the relative chemical abundances between ci meteorites and the solar photosphere exhibit a significant trend with condensation temperature. a trend with condensation temperature is also seen when the solar photospheric abundances are compared to those of nearby solar twins. we use both these trends to determine the alteration of the elemental abundances of the meteorties and the photosphere by fractionation and calculate a new set of primordial solar system abundances. 
  gravity induced resonant emission (gire) is a new phenomenon recently reported; we have analyzed the solar emissions on the basis of gire. we have computed the euv solar spectrum using gire wave length as a part of studying coronal heating problem. we find all the solar observations converge in gire and the gire wave length is sufficient to study all the solar emissions. 
  total solar irradiance variations, about 0.1% between solar activity maximum and minimum, are available from accurate satellite measurements since 1978 and thus do not provide useful information on longer-term secular trends. recently, krivova et al., 2007 reconstructed, using suitable models, the total solar irradiance from the end of the maunder minimum to the present, based on variations of the surface distribution of the solar magnetic field. the latter is calculated from the long historical record of the sunspot numbers using a simple but consistent physical model. there are many classes of proposed prediction methods for solar cycles behavior, based on different direct solar activity indices or on various valuable proxies. in particular, the precursor based methods, utilize a given proxy index to predict the future evolution of solar activity. long-term time series of sunspot numbers, allow us to reliably predict the behavior of the next solar cycle, few years in advance. in previous papers we predicted the full-shape curve of future solar cycles, using a proper non-linear dynamics method applied to monthly smoothed sunspot numbers. in particular, we proved that a sufficiently reliable phase-amplitude prediction of the current solar cycle 24, requires the knowledge of the initial increasing phase of the cycle spanning at least two years. the aim of the present paper is to give a robust long-term prediction of solar cycle activity, many years in advance and for at least three successive solar cycles using the same nonlinear method and, as solar activity proxy index, the reconstructed total solar irrandiance. 
  we study solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays (gcrs) during the deep solar minimum, including the declining phase, of solar cycle 23 and compare the results of this unusual period with the results obtained during similar phases of the previous solar cycles 20, 21, and 22. these periods consist of two epochs each of negative and positive polarities of the heliospheric magnetic field from the north polar region of the sun. in addition to cosmic ray data, we utilize simultaneous solar and interplanetary plasmafield data including the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. we study the relation between simultaneous variations in cosmic ray intensity and solarinterplanetary parameters during the declining and the minimum phases of cycle 23. we compare these relations with those obtained for the same phases in the three previous solar cycles. we observe certain peculiar features in cosmic ray modulation during the minimum of solar cycle 23 including the record high gcr intensity. we find, during this unusual minimum, that the correlation of gcr intensity is poor with sunspot number (r = -0.41), better with interplanetary magnetic field (r = -0.66), still better with solar wind velocity (r = -0.80) and much better with the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet (r = -0.92). in our view, it is not the diffusion or the drift alone, but the solar wind convection is the most likely additional effect responsible for the record high gcr intensity observed during the deep minimum of solar cycle 23. 
  solar power models are a crucial element of solar-powered uav design and performance analysis. during the conceptual design phase, their accuracy directly relates to the accuracy of the predicted performance metrics and thus the final design characteristics of the solar-powered uav. likewise, during the operations phase of a solar-powered uav accurate solar power income models are required to predict and assess the solar power system performance. however, the existing literature on solar-powered uavs uses highly simplified solar power models. this technical report therefore, first, introduces a high-fidelity solar power model that takes into account the exact aircraft attitude, aircraft geometry, and physical effects such as temperature and the sun radiation's angle-of-incidence that influence the overall solar power system efficiency. second, models that require a reduced set of input data and are thus more appropriate for the initial design phase of solar-powered uavs are derived from the high-fidelity model. third, the models are compared and verified against flight data from a 28-hour continuous daynight solar-powered flight. the results indicate that our high-fidelity model allows a prediction of the average solar power income with an error of less than 5% whereas previous models were only accurate to about 18%. 
  the results of precise analysis of elements and isotopes in meteorites, comets, the earth, the moon, mars, jupiter, the solar wind, solar flares, and the solar photosphere since 1960 reveal fingerprints of a local supernova (sn), undiluted by interstellar material. heterogeneous sn debris formed the planets. the sun formed on the neutron (n) rich sn core. the ground-state masses of nuclei reveal repulsive n-n interactions that trigger n-emission and a series of nuclear reactions that generate solar luminosity, the solar wind, and the measured flux of solar neutrinos. the location of the sun's high-density core shifts relative to the solar surface as gravitational forces exerted by the major planets cause the sun to experience abrupt acceleration and deceleration, like a yoyo on a string, in its orbit about the ever-changing centre-of-mass of the solar system. solar cycles (surface magnetic activity, solar eruptions, and sunspots) and major climate changes arise from changes in the depth of the energetic sn core remnant in the interior of the sun. 
  using data from the global oscillations network group (gong) that covers the period from 1995 to 1998 we study the change in frequencies of solar oscillations with solar activity. from these frequencies we attempt to determine any possible variation in solar structure with solar activity. we do not find any evidence of a change in the convection zone depth or extent of overshoot below the convection zone during the solar cycle. 
  mass-fractionation enriches light elements and the lighter isotopes of each element at the solar surface, making a photosphere that is 91 percent h and 9 percent he. the solar interior consists mostly of elements that comprise 99 percent of ordinary meteorites (fe, o, ni, si, s, mg and ca) elements made in the deep interior of a supernova. solar energy arises from a series of nuclear reactions triggered by neutron-emission from the collapsed supernova core on which the sun formed. solar mass-fractionation, solar neutrinos, and the annual solar-wind outpouring of 3 e43 h atoms from the solar surface are by-products of solar luminosity. 
  this talk answers a series of questions. why study solar neutrinos? what does the combined standard model (solar plus electroweak) predict for solar neutrinos? why are the calculations of neutrino fluxes robust? what are the three solar neutrino problems? what have we learned in the first thirty years of solar neutrino research? for the next decade, what are the most important solvable problems in the physics of solar neutrinos? what are the most important problems in the astrophysics of solar neutrinos? 
  we elucidate effects of solar density fluctuations on neutrino propagation through the sun. using data from the recent solar neutrino and kamland experiments we provide stringent limits on solar density fluctuations. it is shown that the neutrino data constrains solar density fluctuations to be less than beta = 0.05 at the 70 % confidence level, where beta is the fractional fluctuation around the value given by the standard solar model. we find that the best fit to the combined solar neutrino and kamland data is given by beta = 0. 
  i give an overview of the recent developments in the solar neutrino field. i focus on the borexino detector, which has uncovered the solar neutrino spectrum below 5 mev, providing new tests and confirmation for solar neutrino oscillations. i report on the updated measurements of the 8b solar neutrino flux by water cherenkov and organic scintillator detectors. i review the precision measurement of the 7be solar neutrino flux by borexino and the search for its day-night asymmetry. i present borexino's latest result on the study of pep and cno neutrinos. finally, i discuss the outstanding questions in the field and future solar neutrino experiments. 
  we use dual-site radio observations of interplanetary scintillation (ips) with extremely long baselines (elb) to examine meridional flow characteristics of the ambient fast solar wind at plane-of-sky heliocentric distances of 24-85 solar radii (r\odot). our results demonstrate an equatorwards deviation of 3-4{\deg} in the bulk fast solar wind flow direction over both northern and southern solar hemispheres during different times in the declining phase of solar cycle 23. 
  the correlation between solar irradiance and the 11-year solar activity cycle is evident in the body of measurements made from space, which extend over the past four decades. models relating variation in solar irradiance to photospheric magnetism have made significant progress in explaining most of the apparent trends in these observations. there are, however, persistent discrepancies between different measurements and models in terms of the absolute radiometry, secular variation and the spectral dependence of the solar cycle variability. we present an overview of solar irradiance measurements and models, and discuss the key challenges in reconciling the divergence between the two. 
  an imroved standard solar model, with more accurate input parameters and more accurate treatment of plasma physics effects, predicts a solar neutrino flux which is consistent within experimental uncertainties with the solar neutrino observations after 1986. 
  the interaction of helical convective motions and differential rotation in the solar convection zone results in turbulent drift of a large-scale magnetic field. we discuss the pumping mechanism and its impact on the solar dynamo. 
  the energy spectrum of the weak solar soft x-ray bursts are investigated using the data of the interball project. 
  we calculate accurate solar models and report the detailed time dependences of important solar quantities. we use helioseismology to constrain the luminosity evolution of the sun and report the discovery of semi-convection in evolved solar models that include diffusion. in addition, we compare the computed sound speeds with the results of p-mode observations by bison, golf, gong, lowl, and mdi instruments. we contrast the neutrino predictions from a set of eight standard-like solar models and four deviant (or deficient) solar models with the results of solar neutrino experiments. for solar neutrino and for helioseismological applications, we present present-epoch numerical tabulations of characteristics of the standard solar model as a function of solar radius, including the principal physical and composition variables, sound speeds, neutrino fluxes, and functions needed for calculating solar neutrino oscillations. 
  we determine the age and mass of the three best solar twin candidates in open cluster m67 through lithium evolutionary models. we computed a grid of evolutionary models with non-standard mixing at metallicity [feh] = 0.01 with the toulouse-geneva evolution code for a range of stellar masses. we estimated the mass and age of 10 solar analogs belonging to the open cluster m67. we made a detailed study of the three solar twins of the sample, ypb637, ypb1194, and ypb1787. we obtained a very accurate estimation of the mass of our solar analogs in m67 by interpolating in the grid of evolutionary models. the three solar twins allowed us to estimate the age of the open cluster, which is 3.87+0.55-0.66 gyr, which is better constrained than former estimates. our results show that the 3 solar twin candidates have one solar mass within the errors and that m67 has a solar age within the errors, validating its use as a solar proxy. m67 is an important cluster when searching for solar twins. 
  we report the first observation of a 27 day period component in daily maximum temperature recorded at widely spaced locations in australia. the 27 day component, extracted by band pass filtering, is correlated with the variation of daily solar radio flux during years close to solar minimum. we demonstrate that the correlation is related to the emergence of regions of solar activity on the sun separated, temporally, from the emergence of other active regions. in this situation, which occurs only near solar minimum, the observed 27 day variation of temperature can be in phase or out of phase with the 27 day variation of solar activity. during solar maximum correlation of temperature and solar activity is much less defined. the amplitude of the 27 day temperature response to solar activity is large, at times as high as 6 degrees c, and much larger than the well documented temperature response to the 11 year cycle of solar activity. we demonstrate that the 27 day temperature response is localised to the australian continent and increases towards the centre of the continent. several aspects of the 27 day temperature response are consistent with a 27 day period solar input to the earth continents generating large scale planetary waves. 
  solar meridian observations have been used to evaluate the solar activity of the past. some important examples are the solar meridian observations made at the basilica of san petronio in bologna by several astronomers and the observations made by hevelius published in his book machina coelestis. however, we do not know whether these observations, which were not aimed to estimate the solar activity, are reliable for evaluating solar activity. in this paper, we present the marginal notes about sunspots that are included in the manuscripts of the meridian solar observations made at the royal observatory of the spanish navy during the period 1833-1840. we compare these observations with other solar activity indices such as sunspot area and number. our conclusion is that solar meridian observations should be used with extreme caution to evaluate past solar activity. 
  this publication provides an overview of magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere with the focus lying on the corona. the solar magnetic field couples the solar interior with the visible surface of the sun and with its atmosphere. it is also responsible for all solar activity in its numerous manifestations. thus, dynamic phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and flares are magnetically driven. in addition, the field also plays a crucial role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona as well as in accelerating the solar wind. our main emphasis is the magnetic field in the upper solar atmosphere so that photospheric and chromospheric magnetic structures are mainly discussed where relevant for higher solar layers. also, the discussion of the solar atmosphere and activity is limited to those topics of direct relevance to the magnetic field. after giving a brief overview about the solar magnetic field in general and its global structure, we discuss in more detail the magnetic field in active regions, the quiet sun and coronal holes. 
  on the basis of morphological analysis of yearly values of the maximum cme (coronal mass ejection) speed index, the sunspot number and total sunspot area, sunspot magnetic field, and solar flare index, the solar wind speed and interplanetary magnetic field strength, and the geomagnetic ap and dst indices, we point out the particularities of solar and geomagnetic activity during the last cycle 23, the long minimum which followed it and the ascending branch of cycle 24. we also analyze temporal offset between the maximum cme speed index and the above-mentioned solar, geomagnetic, and interplanetary indices. it is found that this solar activity index, analyzed jointly with other solar activity, interplanetary parameters, and geomagnetic activity indices, shows a hysteresis phenomenon. it is observed that these parameters follow different paths for the ascending and the descending phases of solar cycle 23. it is noticed that the hysteresis phenomenon represents a clue in the search for physical processes responsible for linking the solar activity to the near-earth and geomagnetic responses. 
  the variation in the radiative output of the sun, described in terms of solar irradiance, is important to climatology. a common assumption is that solar irradiance variability is driven by its surface magnetism. verifying this assumption has, however, been hampered by the fact that models of solar irradiance variability based on solar surface magnetism have to be calibrated to observed variability. making use of realistic three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere and state-of-the-art solar magnetograms from the solar dynamics observatory, we present a model of total solar irradiance (tsi) that does not require any such calibration. in doing so, the modeled irradiance variability is entirely independent of the observational record. (the absolute level is calibrated to the tsi record from the total irradiance monitor.) the model replicates 95% of the observed variability between april 2010 and july 2016, leaving little scope for alternative drivers of solar irradiance variability at least over the time scales examined (days to years). 
  high speed solar wind streams (hsss) are very efficient drivers of geomagnetic activity at high latitudes. in this paper we use a recently developed \delta{h} parameter of geomagnetic activity, calculated from the night-side hourly magnetic field measurements of the sodankyl\"a observatory, as a proxy for solar wind (sw) speed at monthly time resolution in 1914-2014 (solar cycles 15-24). the seasonal variation in the relation between monthly \delta{h} and solar wind speed is taken into account by calculating separate regressions between \delta{h} and sw speed for each month. thereby, we obtain a homogeneous series of proxy values for monthly solar wind speed for the last 100 years. we find that the strongest hss-active months of each solar cycle occur in the declining phase, in years 1919, 1930, 1941, 1952, 1959, 1973, 1982, 1994 and 2003. practically all these years are the same or adjacent to the years of annual maximum solar wind speeds. this implies that the most persistent coronal holes, lasting for several solar rotations and leading to the highest annual sw speeds, are also the sources of the highest monthly sw speeds. accordingly, during the last 100 years, there were no coronal holes of short duration (of about one solar rotation) that would produce faster monthly (or solar rotation) averaged solar wind than the most long-living coronal holes in each solar cycle produce. 
  solar neutrinos are discussed in the light of the new data and of recent progress in helioseismology. most attention is given to the new status of standard solar models due to seismically measured density and sound speed in the inner solar core. the elementary particle solutions to the solar neutrino problem and their observational signatures are discussed. 
  we report our first results on comparing the variations of the solar internal rotation with solar activity, as predicted by non-linear solar dynamo modelling, with helioseismic measurements using the soho mdi data. 
  we incorporate all existing solar neutrino flux measurements and take solar model flux uncertainties into account in deriving global fits to parameter space for the msw and vacuum solutions of the solar neutrino problem. 
  it is shown that the large angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem with a bi-maximal neutrino mixing matrix implies an energy-independent suppression of the solar nu_e flux. the present solar neutrino data exclude this solution of the solar neutrino problem at 99.6% cl. 
  this paper emphasizes the connection between solar and extra-solar debris disks: how models and observations of the solar system are helping us understand the debris disk phenomenon, and vice versa, how debris disks are helping us place our solar system into context. 
  solar orbiter is intended to become esa's next solar mission in heritage of the successful soho project. the scientific objectives of the mission, its design, and its scientific payload are reviewed. specific emphasis is given to the perspectives of solar orbiter with respect to helioseismology. 
  we briefly review the observations of the solar photosphere and pinpoint some open questions related to the magnetohydrodynamics of this layer of the sun. we then discuss the current modelling efforts, addressing among other problems, that of the origin of supergranulation. 
  the sun is the closest star to our planet and it is the most studied, perhaps, there exist too much procesess not-understood. one of the solar processes that have a direct interaction with the earth is the solar wind. the solar wind is defined as the plasma expulsed from the solar atmosphere, this wind was cataloged and is considered that have three components:   - passive solar wind: is the constant component of the solar wind. - supersonic and quasistady flux. - sporadic supersonic flux.   we present and brief explanation of the parker's model of the solar wind and a correlation analysis between solar micro radio bursts and the change of the solar wind parameters. 
  we present a method to derive outflow velocities in the solar corona using different data sets including solar wind mass flux coming from the swansoho instrument, electron density values from lasco-c2 and interplanetary solar wind velocities derived from ground-based interplanetary scintillation observations (ips).   in a first step, we combine the lasco electron densities at 6 solar radii and the ips velocities, and compare the product to the swan mass fluxes. it is found that this product represents the actual mass flux at 6 solar radii for the fast wind, but not for the slow wind. in regions dominated by the slow wind, the fluxes derived from swan are systematically smaller. this is interpreted as a proof that the fast solar wind has reached its terminal velocity at about 6 solar radii and expands with constant velocity beyond this distance. on the contrary, the slow solar wind has reached only half of its terminal value and is thus accelerated further out.   in a second step, we combine the lasco-c2 density profiles and the swan flux data to derive velocity profiles in the corona between 2.5 and 6 solar radii. such profiles can be used to test models of the acceleration mechanism of the fast solar wind. 
  standard solar models (ssm) are facing nowadays a new puzzle: the solar composition problem. new determinations of solar metal abundances lead ssm calculations to conflict with helioseismological measurements, showing discrepancies that extend from the convection zone to the solar core and can not be easily assigned to deficiencies in the modelling of the solar convection zone. we present updated solar neutrino fluxes and uncertainties for two ssm with high (old) and low (new) solar metallicity determinations. the uncertainties in iron and carbon abundances are the largest contribution to the uncertainties of the solar neutrino fluxes. the uncertainty on the ^14n+p -&gt; ^15o+g rate is the largest of the non-composition uncertainties to the cno neutrino fluxes. we propose an independent method to help identify which ssm is the correct one. present neutrino data can not distinguish the solar neutrino predictions of both models but ongoing measurements can help to solve the puzzle. 
  several lunar missions are planned ahead and there is an increasing demand for efficient photovoltaic power generation in the moon. the knowledge of solar cell operation in the lunar surface obtained during early seventies need to be updated considering current views on solar variability and emerging space solar cell technologies. in this paper some aspects of the solar cell performance expected under variable lunar radiation environment during future space missions to moon are addressed. we have calculated relative power expected from different types of solar cells under extreme solar proton irradiation conditions and high lunar daytime temperature. it is also estimated that 2-3 % of annual solar cell degradation is most probable during the future lunar missions. we have also discussed photovoltaic power generation in long term lunar bases emphasizing technological needs such as sunlight concentration, solar cell cooling and magnetic shielding of radiation for improving the efficiency of solar cells in the lunar environment. 
  this paper presents results of comparison between observations of coronal holes in the uv (soho eit) and microwave emission (17, 5.7 ghz, 327 and 150.9 mhz, norh, ssrt and nancy radioheliographs), and solar wind parameters, according to the ace spacecraft data over the period 12 march--31 may 2007. increase in the solar wind velocity up to ~600 kms was found to correlate with decrease in the uv flux in the central parts of the solar disk. the connection between parameters of the microwave emission at three different solar atmosphere levels and the solar wind velocity near the earth's orbit was determined. this connection suggests existence of common mechanisms of solar wind acceleration from chromospheric altitudes to the upper corona. we also suppose existence of two different mechanisms of the solar wind acceleration at altitudes of less and more than one solar radius. 
  we present evidence that the sound-speed variation with solar activity has a two-layer configuration, similar to the one observed below an active region, which consists of a negative layer near the solar surface and a positive one in the layer immediately below the first one. frequency differences between the activity minimum and maximum of solar cycle 23, obtained applying global helioseismology to the michelson doppler imager (mdi) on board soho, is used to determine the sound-speed variation from below the base of the convection zone to a few mm below the solar surface. we find that the sound speed at solar maximum is smaller than at solar minimum at the limit of our determination (5.5 mm). the min-to-max difference decreases in absolute values until ~7 mm. at larger depths, the sound speed at solar maximum is larger than at solar minimum and their difference increases with depth until ~10 mm. at this depth, the relative difference is less than half of the value observed at the lowest depth determination. at deeper layers, it slowly decreases with depth until there is no difference between maximum and minimum activity. 
  we analyze in situ measurements of solar wind velocity obtained by the advanced composition explorer (ace) spacecraft during the solar activity cycle 23. we calculated a robust complexity measure, the permutation entropy (s) of solar wind time series at different phases of a solar activity cycle. the permutation entropy measure is first tested on the known dynamical data before its application to solar wind time series. it is observed that complexity of solar wind velocity fluctuations at 1 au shows hysteresis phenomenon while following the ascending and descending phases of the activity cycle. this indicates the presence of multistability in the dynamics governing the solar wind velocity over a solar activity cycle. 
  wavelet analysis of different solar activity indices, sunspot numbers, sunspot areas, flare index, magnetic fields, etc., allows us to investigate the time evolution of some specific features of the solar activity and the underlying dynamo mechanism. the main aim of this work is the analysis of the time-frequency behavior of some magnetic strengtht indices currently taken at the mt. wilson observatory 150-foot solar tower. in particular, we analyzed both the long time series (jan 19, 1970 - jan 22, 2013) of the magnetic plage strength index (mpsi) values and of the mt. wilson sunspot index (mwsi) values, covering the descending phase of cycle 20, the full solar cycles 21-23 and the current part of the 24 solar cycle. this study is a further contribution to detect the changes in the multiscale quasiperiodic variations in the integrated magnetic solar activity with a comparison between past solar cycles and the current one, which is one of the weaker recorded in the past 100 years. indeed, it is well known that an unusual and deep solar minimum occurred between solar cycles 23 and 24 and the time-frequency behavior of some magnetic strengtht indices can help to better interpret the responsible mechanisms. 
  we analyze in situ measurements of solar wind velocity obtained by advanced composition explorer (ace) spacecraft and helios spacecraft during the years 1998-2012 and 1975-1983 respectively. the data belong to mainly solar cycle 23 (1996-2008) and solar cycle 21 (1976-1986) respectively. we use directed horizontal visibility graph (dhvg) algorithm and estimate a graph functional, namely, the degree distance (d) as the kullback-leibler divergence (kld) argument to understand time irreversibility of solar wind time series. we estimate this degree distance irreversibility parameter for these time series at different phases of solar activity cycle. irreversibility parameter is first established for known dynamical data and then applied for solar wind velocity time series. it is observed that irreversibility in solar wind velocity fluctuations show similar behaviour at 0.3 au (helios data) and 1 au (ace data). moreover it changes over the different phases of solar activity cycle. 
  we have analyzed the total solar irradiance (tsi) and the spectral solar irradiance as ultraviolet emission (uv) in the wavelength range 115-180 nm, observed with the instruments tim and solstice within the framework of sorce (the solar radiation and climate experiment) during the long solar minimum between the 23rd and 24th cycles. the wavelet analysis reveals an increase in the magnetic flux in the latitudinal zone of the sunspot activity, accompanied with an increase in the tsi and uv on the surface rotation timescales of solar activity complexes. in-phase coherent structures between the mid-latitude magnetic flux and tsiuv appear when the long-lived complexes of the solar activity are present. these complexes, which are related to long- lived sources of magnetic fields under the photosphere, are maintained by magnetic fluxes reappearing in the same longitudinal regions. during the deep solar minimum (the period of the absence of sunspots) a coherent structure has been found, in which the phase between the integrated mid-latitude magnetic flux is ahead of the total solar irradiance on the timescales of the surface rotation. 
  theoretical aspects of a solar sail material degradation are presented when the solar electromagnetic and corpuscular forms of radiation were considered as sources of degradation. the analysis of the interaction of two components of solar radiation, the electromagnetic radiation and radiation of low- and high-energy electrons, protons, and helium ions emitted by the sun with the solar-sail materials is discussed. the physical processes of the interactions of photons, electrons, protons and alpha-particles with sail material atoms and nuclei, leading to the degradation and ionization of solar sail materials are analyzed. the dependence of reflectivity and absorption for solar sail materials on temperature and on wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum of solar radiation is investigated. it is shown that the temperature of a solar sail increases approximately as t r^(-25), with the decrease of the heliocentric distance r, when are taking into account the temperature dependence of optical parameters of the solar sail material. 
  the use of different solar activity indices like sunspot numbers, sunspot areas, flare index, magnetic fields, etc., allows us to investigate the time evolution of some specific features of the solar activity and the underlying dynamo mechanism. one of the problems when using these activity indices for some statistical analyses is the reliable determination of the maximum phases of different solar cycles which are generally characterized by a multi-peaked structure due to the presence of the so-called \emph {gnevyshev gap}. the main aim of this work is to propose a general method, without the introduction of ad hoc heuristic parameters, to determine the duration of a given solar cycle maximum phase through a long-term solar activity index like the monthly smoothed sunspot number (ssn). the resulting extended solar maxima allows us to include the multi-peaked structure of solar cycles and further the proposed method allows us to predict the solar maximum duration of the current solar cycle 24. 
  solar irradiance is considered one of the main natural factors affecting terrestrial climate, and its variations are included in most numerical models estimating the effects of natural versus anthropogenic factors for climate change. solar wind causing geomagnetic disturbances is another solar activity agent whose role in climate change is not yet fully estimated but is a subject of intense research. for the purposes of climate modeling, it is essential to evaluate both the past and the future variations of solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity which are ultimately due to the variations of solar magnetic fields. direct measurements of solar magnetic fields are available for a limited period, but can be reconstructed from geomagnetic activity records. here we present a reconstruction of total solar irradiance based on geomagnetic data, and a forecast of the future irradiance and geomagnetic activity relevant for the expected climate change. 
  the sun provides the energy necessary to sustain our existence. while the sun provides for us, it is also capable of taking away. the weather and climatic scales of solar evolution and the sun-earth connection are not well understood. there has been tremendous progress in the century since the discovery of solar magnetism - magnetism that ultimately drives the electromagnetic, particulate and eruptive forcing of our planetary system. there is contemporary evidence of a decrease in solar magnetism, perhaps even indicators of a significant downward trend, over recent decades. are we entering a minimum in solar activity that is deeper and longer than a typical solar minimum, a "grand minimum"? how could we tell if we are? what is a grand minimum and how does the sun recover? these are very pertinent questions for modern civilization. in this paper we present a hypothetical demonstration of entry and exit from grand minimum conditions based on a recent analysis of solar features over the past 20 years and their possible connection to the origins of the 11(-ish) year solar activity cycle. 
  we present observational signatures of solar cycle 25 onset. those signatures are visibly following a migratory path from high to low latitudes. they had starting points that are asymmetrically offset in each hemisphere at times that are 21-22 years after the corresponding, same polarity, activity bands of solar cycle 23 started their migration. those bands define the so-called "extended solar cycle." the four magnetic bands currently present in the system are approaching a mutually cancelling configuration, and solar minimum conditions are imminent. further, using a tuned analysis of the daily band latitude-time diagnostics, we are able to utilize the longitudinal wave number (m=1) variation in the data to more clearly reveal the presence of the solar cycle 25 bands. this clarification illustrates that prevalently active longitudes (different in each hemisphere) exist at mid-latitudes presently, lasting many solar rotations, that can be used for detailed study over the next several years with instruments like the spectrograph on iris, the spectropolarimeter on hinode, and, when they come online, similar instruments on the daniel k. inouye solar telescope (dkist) as we watch those bands evolve following the cancellation of the solar cycle 24 activity bands at the equator late in 2019. 
  observations of the solar corona and the solar wind discover that the solar wind is unsteady and originates from the impulsive events near the surface of the sun's atmosphere. how solar coronal activities affect the properties of the solar wind is a fundamental issue in heliophysics. we report a simulation and theoretical investigation of how nanoflare accelerated electron beams affect the kinetic-scale properties of the solar wind and generate coherent radio emission. we show that nanoflare-accelerated electron beams can trigger a nonlinear electron two stream instability, which generates kinetic alfv\'en and whistler waves, as well as a non-maxwellian electron velocity distribution function, consistent with observations of the solar wind. the plasma coherent emission produced in our model agrees well with the observations of type iii, j and v solar radio bursts. open questions in the kinetic solar wind model are also discussed. 
  the ngvla has the potential to play a significant role in characterizing properties of the outer corona and the heating and acceleration of the solar wind into the inner heliosphere. in particular, using distant background sources to transilluminate the foreground corona and solar wind, a variety of radio propagation phenomena can be used to map plasma properties as a function of solar elongation and position angle throughout the solar cycle. these include angular broadening, interplanetary scintillations, and differential faraday rotation, which can be used to map the solar wind velocity, determine properties of solar wind turbulence, and constrain the solar wind magnetic field. these observations will provide a global characterization of the solar wind that will be highly complementary to in situ observations made by various spacecraft. in addition, such observations can be used to probe disturbances in the solar wind -- coronal mass ejections, for example -- that may impact the near-earth environment. 
  we summarize the results of solar neutrino experiments and update a solar model independent analysis of solar neutrino data. we discuss the implications of helioseismology on solar models and predicted solar neutrino fluxes. finally , we discuss the potential of new experiments for detecting specific signatures of the proposed solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle. 
  solar oscillations frequencies show a distinct change with solar activity. the changes in frequencies can be used to study the time variation of solar structure. we discuss constraints on the changes in solar structure with time as obtained with helioseismic data covering the last six years. the frequency variations appear to be dominated by changes in the near-surface layers rather than by changes in the structure of the deeper layers. 
  we reexamine the theoretical limit on the axion coupling to two photons, g_{a\gamma \gamma}, in the light of a new solar model (seismic solar model) and the latest solar neutrino observations, the super-kamiokande and the sudbury neutrino observatory (sno). from the comparison of the theoretically expected and the measured neutrino fluxes, we set a limit g_{a\gamma \gamma} &lt; 4.0\times 10^{-10} ~\mathrm{gev} ^{-1}. this limit based on a new procedure is about a factor of 3 improvement over the previous theoretical limit and a more severe limit than the solar axion experiments. therefore this limit is the most stringent limit on solar axions. 
  the solar argon abundance cannot be directly derived by spectroscopic observations of the solar photosphere. the solar ar abundance is evaluated from solar wind measurements, nucleosynthetic arguments, observations of b stars, hii regions, planetary nebulae, and noble gas abundances measured in jupiter's atmosphere. these data lead to a recommended argon abundance of n(ar) = 91,200(+-)23,700 (on a scale where si = 10^6 atoms). the recommended abundance for the solar photosphere (on a scale where log n(h) = 12) is a(ar)photo = 6.50(+-)0.10, and taking element settling into account, the solar system (protosolar) abundance is a(ar)solsys = 6.57(+-)0.10. 
  in local helioseismology numerical simulations of wave propagation are useful to model the interaction of solar waves with perturbations to a background solar model. however, the solution to the equations of motions include convective modes that can swamp the waves we are interested in. for this reason, we choose to first stabilise the background solar model against convection by altering the vertical pressure gradient. here we compare the eigenmodes of our convectively stabilised model with a standard solar model (model s) and find a good agreement. 
  during the solar minimum stereo observations show that the three-dimensional structure of the solar corona can be described well by a tilted bi-polar magnetic configuration. the slow solar wind is modeled using three-fluid model that includes heavy ions, such as he ii and o vi. the model is initialized with dipole magnetic field and spherically symmetric density. the resulting steady state non-potential and non-uniform streamer configuration calculated with this model is compared to stereo observations of the streamer density structure. sohouvcs observations are used to compare the o vi emission to model results. we discuss the unique properties of the solar wind produced in this configuration. 
  energetic (suprathermal) solar particles, accelerated in the interplanetary medium, contribute to the solar wind pressure, in particular during high solar activity periods. we estimated the effect of the increase of solar wind pressure due to suprathermal particles on magnetospheric transmissivity of galactic cosmic rays in the case of one recent solar event. 
  in this short review, i present some of the recent progresses on the pending questions of solar physics. these questions let us revisit the solar wind, the solar dynamo problem, the dynamics of the photosphere and finally have a glimpse at other solar type stars. discussing the use of direct numerical simulations in solar physics, i show that the full numerical calculation of the flow in a single supergranule would require more electric power than the luminosity of the sun itself with present computer technology. 
  in this paper, starting from the updated time series of global temperature anomalies, ta, we show how the solar component affects the observed behavior using, as an indicator of solar activity, the solar sunspot number ssn. the results that are found clearly show that the solar component has an important role and affects significantly the current observed stationary behavior of global temperature anomalies. the solar activity behavior and its future role will therefore be decisive in determining whether or not the restart of the increase of temperature anomalies observed since 1975 will occur. 
  the studies of solar neutrinos and helioseismology have been closely intertwined since the first neutrino experiment and the first observations of solar oscillations in the sixties. early detailed helioseismic analyses provided strong support for the standard solar model and hence a clear indication that the solution to the discrepancy between the predicted and observed neutrino fluxes had to be found in terms of neutrino physics, as now fully confirmed by direct observations. with the full characterization of neutrino properties we are now in a position to combine neutrino observations and helioseismology to obtain a more complete understanding of conditions in the solar core. here i provide a personal and largely historical overview of these developments. 
  the predictions of an improved standard solar model are compared with the observations of the four solar neutrino experiments. the improved model includes premain sequence evolution, element diffusion, partial ionization effects, and all the possible nuclear reactions between the main elements. it uses updated values for the initial solar element abundances, the solar age, the solar luminosity, the nuclear reaction rates and the radiative opacities. neither nuclear equilibrium, nor complete ionization are assumed. the calculated ^8b solar neutrino flux is consistent, within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties, with the solar neutrino flux measured by kamiokande. the results from the ^{37}cl and ^{71}ga radiochemical experiments seem to suggest that the terrestrial ^7be solar neutrino flux is much smaller than that predicted. however, the present terrestrial ``defecit'' of ^7be solar neutrinos may be due to the use of inaccurate theoretical neutrino absorption cross sections near threshold for extracting solar neutrino fluxes from production rates. conclusive evidence for a real deficit of ^7be solar neutrinos will require experiments such as borexino or hellaz. a real defecit of ^7be solar neutrinos can be due to either astrophysical reasons or neutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. only future neutrino experiments, such as sno, superkamiokande, borexino and hellaz, will be able to provide conclusive evidence that the solar neutrino problem is a consequence of neutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. earlier indications may be provided by long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. 
  an improved standard solar model has been used to calculate the fluxes of standard solar neutrinos. it includes premain sequence evolution, element diffusion, partial ionization effects, and all the possible nuclear reactions between the main elements. it uses updated values for the initial solar element abundances, the solar age, the solar luminosity, the nuclear reaction rates and the radiative opacities. neither nuclear equilibrium, nor complete ionization are assumed. the calculated solar neutrino fluxes are compared with published results from the four solar neutrino experiments. the calculated ^8b solar neutrino flux is consistent, within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties, with the solar neutrino observations at homestake and kamiokande. the observations suggest that the ^7be solar neutrino flux is much smaller than that predicted. however, conclusive evidence for the suppression of the ^7be solar neutrino flux will require experiments like borexino and hellaz. if the ^7be solar neutrino flux is suppressed, it still can be due either to standard physics and astrophysics or neutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. only future neutrino experiments, such as sno, superkamiokande, borexino and hellaz, will be able to show that the solar neutrino problem is a consequence of neutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. 
  we update the sohoswan h lyman-alpha brightness analysis to cover the 1996-2008 time interval. a forward model applied to the intensity maps provides the latitude and time dependence of the interstellar hydrogen ionisation rate over more than a full solar cycle. the hydrogen ionisation, being almost entirely due to charge-exchange with solar wind ions, reflects closely the solar wind flux. our results show that the solar wind latitudinal structure during the present solar minimum is strikingly different from the previous minimum, with a much wider slow solar wind equatorial belt which persists until at least the end of 2008. we compute absolute values of the in-ecliptic h ionisation rates using omni solar wind data and use them to calibrate our ionisation rates at all heliographic latitudes. we then compare the resulting fluxes with the synoptic lascoc2 electron densities at 6 solar radii. the two time-latitude patterns are strikingly similar over all the cycle. this comparison shows that densities at 6 solar radii can be used to infer the solar wind type close to its source, with high (resp. low) densities tracing the slow (resp. fast) solar wind, simply because the density reflects at which altitude occurs the acceleration. the comparison between the two minima suggests that the fast polar wind acceleration occurs at larger distance during the current minimum compared to the previous one. this difference, potentially linked to the magnetic field decrease or(and) the coronal temperature decrease should be reproduced by solar wind expansion models. 
  solar inter-network magnetic field is the weakest component of solar magnetism, but contributes most of the solar surface magnetic flux. the study on its origin has been constrained by the inadequate tempo-spatial resolution and sensitivity of polarization observations. with dramatic advances in spatial resolution and detective sensitivity, solar spectro-polarimetry provided by the solar optical telescope aboard hinode in an interval from solar minimum to maximum of cycle 24 opens an unprecedented opportunity to study the cyclic behavior of solar inter-network magnetic field. more than 1000 hinode magnetograms observed from 2007 january to 2014 august are selected in the study. it has been found that there is a very slight correlation between sunspot number and magnetic field at the inter-network flux spectrum. from solar minimum to maximum of cycle 24, the flux density of solar inter-network field is invariant, which is 10\pm1 g. the observations suggest that the inter-network magnetic field does not arise from the flux diffusion or flux recycling of solar active regions, thereby indicating the existence of a locally small-scale dynamo. combining the full-disk magnetograms observed by sohomdi and sdohmi in the same period, we find that the area ratio of the inter-network region to the full-disk of the sun apparently decreases from solar minimum to maximum but always exceeds 60\% even though in the phase of solar maximum. 
  total solar irradiance and uv spectral solar irradiance have been monitored since 1978 through a succession of space missions. this is accompanied by the development of models aimed at replicating solar irradiance by relating the variability to solar magnetic activity. the nrlssi and satire-s models provide the most comprehensive reconstructions of total and spectral solar irradiance over the period of satellite observation currently available. there is persistent controversy between the various measurements and models in terms of the wavelength dependence of the variation over the solar cycle, with repercussions on our understanding of the influence of uv solar irradiance variability on the stratosphere. we review the measurement and modelling of uv solar irradiance variability over the period of satellite observation. the satire-s reconstruction is consistent with spectral solar irradiance observations where they are reliable. it is also supported by an independent, empirical reconstruction of uv spectral solar irradiance based on uarssusim measurements from an earlier study. the weaker solar cycle variability produced by nrlssi between 300 and 400 nm is not evident in any available record. we show that although the method employed to construct nrlssi is principally sound, reconstructed solar cycle variability is detrimentally affected by the uncertainty in the ssi observations it draws upon in the derivation. based on our findings, we recommend, when choosing between the two models, the use of satire-s for climate studies. 
  the development of the zeeman-doppler imagine (zdi) technique has provided synoptic observations of surface magnetic fields of low-mass stars. this led the stellar astrophysics community to adopt modeling techniques that have been used in solar physics using solar magnetograms. however, many of these techniques have been neglected by the solar community due to their failure to reproduce solar observations. nevertheless, some of these techniques are still used to simulate the coronae and winds of solar analogs. here we present a comparative study between two mhd models for the solar corona and solar wind. the first type of model is a polytropic wind model, and the second is the physics-based awsom model. we show that while the awsom model consistently reproduces many solar observations, the polytropic model fails to reproduce many of these observations and in the cases it does, its solutions are unphysical. our recommendation is that polytropic models, which are used to estimate mass-loss rates and other parameters of solar analogs, must be first calibrated with solar observations. alternatively, these models can be calibrated with models that capture more detailed physics of the solar corona (such as the awsom model), and that can reproduce solar observations in a consistent manner. without such a calibration, the results of the polytropic models cannot be validated, but they can be wrongly used by others. 
  measurement of the solar wind speed near the sun is important for understanding the acceleration mechanism of the solar wind. in this study, we determine 2d solar wind speeds from 6 to 26 solar radii by applying fourier motion filters to \textit{soho}lasco c3 movies observed from 1999 to 2010. our method successfully reproduces the original flow speeds in the artificially generated data as well as streamer blobs. we measure 2d solar wind speeds from 1-day to 1-year timescales and their variation in solar cycle 24. we find that the solar wind speeds at timescales longer than a month in the solar maximum period are relatively uniform in the azimuthal direction, while they are clearly bimodal in the minimum period, as expected from the \textit{ulysses} observations and ips reconstruction. the bimodal structure appears at around 2006, becomes most distinctive in 2009, and abruptly disappears in 2010. the radial evolution of the solar wind speeds resembles the parker's solar wind solution. 
  we study the solar-activity and solar-polarity dependence of galactic cosmic-ray intensity (cri) on the solar and heliospheric parameters playing a significant role in solar modulation. we utilize the data for cosmic-ray intensity as measured by neutron monitors, solar activity as measured by sunspot number (ssn), interplanetary plasmafield parameters, solar-wind velocity [v] and magnetic field [b], as well as the tilt of the heliospheric current sheet [{\lambda}] and analyse these data for solar cycles 20 - 24 (1965 - 2011). we divide individual solar cycles into four phases, i.e. low, high, increasing, and decreasing solar activity. we perform regression analysis to calculate and compare the cri-response to changes in different solarinterplanetary parameters during (i) different phases of solar activity and (ii) similar activity phases but different polarity states. we find that the cri-response is different during negative (a&lt;0) as compared to positive (a&gt;0) polarity states not only with ssn and {\lambda} but also with b and v. the relative cri-response to changes in various parameters, in negative (a&lt;0) as compared to positive (a&gt;0) state, is solar-activity dependent; it is ~2 to 3 times higher in low solar activity, ~1.5 to 2 times higher in moderate (increasingdecreasing) activity, and it is nearly equal in high solar-activity conditions. although our results can be ascribed to preferential entry of charged particles via the equatorialpolar regions of the heliosphere as predicted by drift models, these results also suggest that we should look for, any polarity-dependent response of solar wind and transport parameters in modulating cri in the heliosphere. 
  solar-analog stars provide an excellent opportunity to study the sun's evolution, i.e. the changes with time in stellar structure, activity, or rotation for solar-like stars. the unparalleled photometric data from the nasa space telescope kepler allows us to study and characterise solar-like stars through asteroseismology. we aim to spectroscopically investigate the fundamental parameter and chromospheric activity of solar analogues and twins, based on observations obtained with the hermes spectrograph and combine them with asteroseismology. therefore, we need to build a solar atlas for the spectrograph, to provide accurate calibrations of the spectroscopically determined abundances of solar and late type stars observed with this instrument and thus perform differential spectral comparisons. we acquire high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopy to construct three solar reference spectra by observing the reflected light of vesta and victoria asteroids and europa (100&lt;sn&lt;450) with the \hermes spectrograph. we then observe the kepler solar analog kic3241581 (sn~170). we constructed three solar spectrum atlases from 385 to 900 nm obtained with the hermes spectrograph from observations of two bright asteroids and europa. a comparison between our solar spectra atlas to the kurucz and harps solar spectrum shows an excellent agreement. kic3241581 was found to be a long-periodic binary system. the fundamental parameter for the stellar primary component are teff=5689+-11k, logg=4.385+-0.005, [feh]=+0.22+-0.01, being in agreement with the published global seismic values confirming its status of solar analogue. kic 3241581 is a metal rich solar analogue with a solar-like activity level in a binary system of unknown period. the chromospheric activity level is compatible to the solar magnetic activity. 
  properties of the sun's interior can be determined accurately from helioseismological measurements of solar oscillations. these measurements, however, are in conflict with photospheric elemental abundances derived using 3-d hydrodynamic models of the solar atmosphere. this divergence of theory and helioseismology is known as the "solar modeling problem". one possible solution is that the photospheric neon abundance, which is deduced indirectly by combining the coronal neo ratio with the photospheric o abundance, is larger than generally accepted. there is some support for this idea from observations of cool stars. the neo abundance ratio has also been found to vary with the solar cycle in the slowest solar wind streams and coronal streamers, and the variation from solar maximum to minimum in streamers (\sim0.1 to 0.25) is large enough to potentially bring some of the solar models into agreement with the seismic data. here we use daily-sampled observations from the euv variability experiment (eve) on the solar dynamics observatory taken in 2010--2014, to investigate whether the coronal neo abundance ratio shows a variation with the solar cycle when the sun is viewed as a star. we find only a weak dependence on, and moderate anti-correlation with, the solar cycle with the ratio measured around 0.2--0.3 mk falling from 0.17 at solar minimum to 0.11 at solar maximum. the effect is amplified at higher temperatures (0.3--0.6 mk) with a stronger anti-correlation and the ratio falling from 0.16 at solar minimum to 0.08 at solar maximum. the values we find at solar minimum are too low to solve the solar modeling problem. 
  frequency and rotational splittings of the solar f-modes are estimated from the gong data. contrary to earlier observations the frequencies of f-modes are found to be close to the theoretically computed values for a standard solar model. the f-mode being essentially a surface mode is a valuable diagnostic probe of the properties of the solar surface, and also provides an independent measure of solar radius. the estimated solar radius is found to be about 0.03% less than what is traditionally used in construction of standard solar models. if this decrease in solar radius is confirmed then the current solar models as well as inversion results will need to be revised. the rotational splittings of the f-modes yield an independent measure of the rotation rate near the solar surface, which is compared with other measurements. 
  the solar sail is a large thin film used to collect solar light pressure for moving of space apparatus. unfortunately, the solar radiation pressure is very small about 9 mknsq.m at earth's orbit. however, the light force significantly increases up to 0.2 - 0.35 nsq.m near the sun. the author offers his research on a new revolutionary highly reflective solar sail which flyby (after special maneuver) near sun and attains velocity up to 400 kmsec and reaching far planets of the solar system in short time or enable flights out of solar system. new, highly reflective sail-mirror allows avoiding the strong heating of the solar sail. it may be useful for probes close to the sun and mercury and venus.   key words: ab-solar sail, highly reflective solar sail, high speed propulsion. 
  geomagnetic activity has two main peaks in the 11-year sunspot cycle caused by two types of solar agents: coronal mass ejections and high speed solar wind streams, whose variations in number and intensity are related to the variations in solar toroidal and poloidal fields, respectively. from the long-term variations in the lag between the two aa-index peaks we derive the long-term variations in solar meridional circulation. we use these relations to test the flux-transport solar dynamo theory and to explain some well known characteristics of the solar cycle. based on these relations, we give a prediction for the amplitude (125) and epoch of the maximum (april 2011) of sunspot cycle 24. 
  this article discusses statistical models for solar flare interval distribution in individual active regions. we analyzed solar flare data in 55 active regions that are listed in the goes soft x-ray flare catalog. we discuss some problems with a conventional procedure to derive probability density functions from any data set and propose a new procedure, which uses the maximum likelihood method and akaike information criterion (aic) to objectively compare some competing probability density functions. we found that lognormal and inverse gaussian models are more likely models than the exponential model for solar flare interval distribution in individual active regions. the results suggest that solar flares do not occur randomly in time; rather, solar flare intervals appear to be regulated by solar flare mechanisms. we briefly mention a probabilistic solar flare forecasting method as an application of a solar flare interval distribution analysis. 
  we analyze the occurrence frequency distributions of peak fluxes p, total fluxes e, and durations t of solar flares over the last three solar cycles (during 1980--2010) from hard x-ray data of hxrbssmm, batsecgro, and rhessi. from the synthesized data we find powerlaw slopes with mean values of \alpha_p=1.72\pm0.08 for the peak flux, \alpha_e=1.60\pm0.14 for the total flux, and \alpha_t=1.98\pm0.35 for flare durations. we find a systematic anti-correlation of the powerlaw slope of peak fluxes as a function of the solar cycle, varying with an approximate sinusoidal variation \alpha_p(t)=\alpha_0+\delta \alpha \cos{[2\pi (t-t_0)t_{cycle}]}, with a mean of \alpha_0=1.73, a variation of \delta \alpha =0.14, a solar cycle period t_{cycle}=12.6 yrs, and a cycle minimum time t_0=1984.1. the powerlaw slope is flattest during the maximum of a solar cycle, which indicates a higher magnetic complexity of the solar corona that leads to an overproportional rate of powerful flares. 
  the main purpose of this study is the determination of solar minimum date of the new sunspot cycle no 24. it is provided by using of four types of mean daily data values for the period jan 01. 2006 - dec 31. 2009: (1) the solar radioindex f10.7; (2) the international sunspot number ri; (3) the total solar irradiance index (tsi), and (4) the daily number of x-ray flares of classes from "b" to "x" from the soft x-ray goes satellite channel (0.1 - 0.8 nm). it is found that the mean starting moment of the upward solar activity tendency (the mean solar minimum) is nov. 06th, 2008. so, the solar cycle no 23 length is estimated to ~12.6 years. a conclusion for a relatively weak general magnitude of solar cycle no 24 is made. by using of relationship based on the "waldmeier's rule" a near maximal mean yearly sunspot number value of 72 \pm 27 has been determined. 
  we generate new standard solar models using newly analyzed nuclear fusion cross sections and present results for helioseismic quantities and solar neutrino fluxes. we discuss the status of the solar abundance problem and investigate whether nonstandard solar models with accretion from the protoplanetary disk might alleviate the problem. we examine a broad range of possibilities, analyzing both metal-enriched and metal-depleted accretion models and exploring three scenarios for the timing of the accretion. only partial solutions are found: one can bring either the depth of the convective zone or the surface helium abundance into agreement with helioseismic results, but not both simultaneously. in addition, detailed results for solar neutrino fluxes show that neutrinos are a competitive source of information about the solar core and can help constrain possible accretion histories of the sun. finally, we briefly discuss how measurements of solar neutrinos from the cn-cycle could shed light on the interaction between the early sun and its protoplanetary disk. 
  the total solar irradiance varies over a solar cycle of 11 years and maybe over cycles with longer period. is the solar diameter variable over time too? we introduce a new method to perform high resolution astrometry of the solar diameter from the ground, through the observations of eclipses by reconsidering the definition of the solar edge. a discussion of the solar diameter and its variations must be linked to the limb darkening function (ldf) using the luminosity evolution of a baily's bead and the profile of the lunar limb available from satellite data. this approach unifies the definition of solar edge with ldf inflection point for eclipses and drift-scan or heliometric methods. the method proposed is applied for the videos of the eclipse in 15 january 2010 recorded in uganda and in india. the result shows light at least 0.85 arcsec beyond the inflection point, and this suggests to reconsider the evaluations of the historical eclipses made with naked eye. 
  solar transients and eruptive phenomena which are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere, can shed new light to the understanding of the outstanding problems like coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration. observations in the entire electromagnetic spectrum of such dynamical processes of large and small-scale transienteruptive events, with highly dynamic magnetic field configuration, and energetic particles, provide crucial information about the plasma processes at mega-kelvin temperature embedded in a complex magnetic field, and also energy build-upenergy-release processes, taking place in such events. one of the most important phenomenological aspects of solar eruptive phenomena is the induced magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) waves generated during these energetic processes, which carry a potential signature to probing the solar active regions. in this paper, we briefly review the recent trends of the transient (e.g., flares) induced quasi-periodic oscillations in the solar atmosphere and discuss their implications in diagnosing the solar active regions, providing the clue to understanding local plasma dynamics and heating. 
  we observed, for the first time, solar neutrinos in the 1.0-1.5 mev energy range. we measured the rate of pep solar neutrino interactions in borexino to be [3.1+-0.6(stat)+-0.3(syst)] counts(day x 100 ton) and provided a constraint on the cno solar neutrino interaction rate of &lt;7.9 counts(day x 100 ton) (95% c.l.). the absence of the solar neutrino signal is disfavored at 99.97% c.l., while the absence of the pep signal is disfavored at 98% c.l. this unprecedented sensitivity was achieved by adopting novel data analysis techniques for the rejection of cosmogenic 11c, the dominant background in the 1-2 mev region. assuming the msw-lma solution to solar neutrino oscillations, these values correspond to solar neutrino fluxes of [1.6+-0.3]x10^8 cm^-2s-1 and 7.7x10^8 cm^-2s-1 (95% c.l.), respectively, in agreement with the standard solar model. these results represent the first measurement of the pep neutrino flux and the strongest constraint of the cno solar neutrino flux to date. 
  we analyze the light curves of the recent solar eclipses measured by the herzberg channel (200-220 nm) of the large yield radiometer (lyra) onboard proba-2. the measurements allow us to accurately retrieve the center- to-limb variations (clv) of the solar brightness. the formation height of the radiation depends on the observing angle so the examination of the clv provide information about a broad range of heights in the solar atmosphere. we employ the 1d nlte radiative transfer code for solar irradiance (cosi) to model the measured light curves and corresponding clv dependencies. the modeling is used to test and constrain the existing 1d models of the solar atmosphere, e.g. the temperature structure of the photosphere and the treatment of the pseudo- continuum opacities in the herzberg continuum range. we show that cosi can accurately reproduce not only the irradiance from the entire solar disk, but also the measured clv. it hence can be used as a reliable tool for modeling the variability of the spectral solar irradiance. 
  the solar-wind energy flux measured near the ecliptic is known to be independent of the solar-wind speed. using plasma data from helios, ulysses, and wind covering a large range of latitudes and time, we show that the solar-wind energy flux is independent of the solar-wind speed and latitude within 10%, and that this quantity varies weakly over the solar cycle. in other words the energy flux appears as a global solar constant. we also show that the very high speed solar-wind (vsw &gt; 700 kms) has the same mean energy flux as the slower wind (vsw &lt; 700 kms), but with a different histogram. we use this result to deduce a relation between the solar-wind speed and density, which formalizes the anti-correlation between these quantities. 
  solar magnetized "tornadoes", a phenomenon discovered in the solar atmosphere, appear as tornado-like structures in the corona but root in the photosphere. like other solar phenomena, solar tornadoes are a feature of magnetized plasma and therefore differ distinctly from terrestrial tornadoes. here we report the first analysis of solar "tornadoes" {two papers which focused on different aspect of solar tornadoes were published in the astrophysical journal letters (li et al. 2012) and nature (wedemeyer-b\"ohm et al. 2012), respectively, during the revision of this letter.}. a detailed case study of two events indicates that they are rotating vertical magnetic structures probably driven by underlying vortex flows in the photosphere. they usually exist as a group and relate to filamentsprominences, another important solar phenomenon whose formation and eruption are still mysteries. solar tornadoes may play a distinct role in the supply of mass and twists to filaments. these findings could lead to a new explanation to filament formation and eruption. 
  the mauna loa observatory record of direct-beam solar irradiance measurements for the years 1958-2010 is analysed to investigate the variation of clear-sky terrestrial insolation with solar activity over more than four solar cycles. the raw irradiance data exhibit a marked seasonal cycle, extended periods of lower irradiance due to emissions of volcanic aerosols, and a long-term decrease in atmospheric transmission independent of solar activity. after correcting for these effects, it is found that clear-sky terrestrial irradiance typically varies by about 0.2 +- 0.1% over the course of the solar cycle, a change of the same order of magnitude as the variations of the total solar irradiance above the atmosphere. an investigation of changes in the clear-sky atmospheric transmission fails to find a significant trend with sunspot number. hence there is no evidence for a yet unknown effect amplifying variations of clear-sky irradiance with solar activity. 
  the sunspot number data during the past 400 years indicates that both the profile and the amplitude of the solar cycle have large variations. some precursors of the solar cycle were identified aiming to predict the solar cycle. the polar field and the geomagnetic index are two precursors which are received the most attention. the geomagnetic variations during the solar minima are potentially caused by the solar polar field by the connection of the solar open flux. the robust prediction skill of the polar field indicates that the memory of the dynamo process is less than 11 yrs within the framework of the babcock-leighton flux transport dynamo. one possible reason to get the short magnetic memory is the high magnetic diffusivity in the convective zone. our recent studies show that the radial downward pumping is another possible reason. based upon the mechanism, we well simulate the cycle irregularities during rgo time period. this opens the possibility to set up a standard dynamo based model to predict the solar cycle. in the end, the no correlation between the polar field and the preceding cycle strength due to the nonlinearities and random mechanisms involved in the sunspot emergences are stressed. 
  we utilize solar rotation average geomagnetic index ap and various solar wind plasma and field parameters for four solar cycles 20-23. we perform analysis to search for a best possible coupling function at 27-day time resolution. regression analysis using these data at different phases of solar activity (increasing including maximumdecreasing including minimum) led us to suggest that the time variation of interplanetary electric potential is a better coupling function for solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. we suspect that a faster rate of change in interplanetary electric potential at the magnetopause might enhance the reconnection rate and energy transfer from the solar wind into the magnetosphere. the possible mechanism that involves the interplanetary potential fluctuations in influencing the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling is being investigated. 
  the solar cycle is reviewed. the 11-year cycle of solar activity is characterized by the rise and fall in the numbers and surface area of sunspots. a number of other solar activity indicators also vary in association with the sunspots including; the 10.7cm radio flux, the total solar irradiance, the magnetic field, flares and coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic activity, galactic cosmic ray fluxes, and radioisotopes in tree rings and ice cores. individual solar cycles are characterized by their maxima and minima, cycle periods and amplitudes, cycle shape, the equatorward drift of the active latitudes, hemispheric asymmetries, and active longitudes. cycle-to-cycle variability includes the maunder minimum, the gleissberg cycle, and the gnevyshev-ohl (even-odd) rule. short-term variability includes the 154-day periodicity, quasi-biennial variations, and double-peaked maxima. we conclude with an examination of prediction techniques for the solar cycle and a closer look at cycles 23 and 24. 
  magnetic field generation in the sun and solar-type stars is modeled here based on the formation of magnetically polarized condensates (b. m. mirza, mod. phys. lett. b 28 (2014) 1450148) under the high density and pressure conditions. the correct orders of magnitude for the time period and the energy loss in a solar cycle are deduced, as well as the enhancement in the energy emission observed during solar cycles. it is shown that this feedback magnetic field along with differential rotation is sufficient to generate the toroidal magnetic field in the solar exterior. the model is useful in determining magnetic polarity reversals, energy generation, and reversal times, in solar-type stars. 
  ludendorff coronal flattening index of the total solar eclipse (tse) on march 9, 2016, was calculated at various distances in solar radius. as a result, we obtained the coronal flattening index \left(\epsilon =a+b\right) at a distance of 2 solar radii is 0.16. the 24^{th} solar cycle phase based on the 2016 tse event obtained -0.64 which showed the corona is pre-minimum type. resulted coronal flattening index value gives a predicted maximum amplitude of the monthly sunspot number (w_{max}) for the 25^{th} solar cycle to be 70\pm65. therefore, the solar activity for 25^{th} solar cycle predicted to be lower than the current solar cycle, which has a maximum sunspot number value of 146 in february 2014 
  cosmic rays interacting in the solar atmosphere produce showers that result in a flux of high-energy neutrinos from the sun. these form an irreducible background to indirect solar wimp co-annihilation searches, which look for heavy dark matter particles annihilating into final states containing neutrinos in the solar core. this background will eventually create a sensitivity floor for indirect wimp co-annihilation searches analogous to that imposed by low-energy solar neutrino interactions for direct dark matter detection experiments. we present a new calculation of the flux of solar atmospheric neutrinos with a detailed treatment of systematic uncertainties inherent in solar atmospheric shower evolution, and we use this to derive the sensitivity floor for indirect solar wimp annihilation analyses. we find that the floor lies less than one order of magnitude beyond the present experimental limits on spin-dependent wimp-proton cross sections for some mass points, and that the high-energy solar atmospheric neutrino flux may be observable with running and future neutrino telescopes. 
  we present observations of a powerful solar eruption, accompanied by an x8.2 solar flare, from noaa active region 12673 on 2017 september 10 by the solar ultraviolet imager (suvi) on the goes-16 spacecraft. suvi is noteworthy for its relatively large field of view, which allows it to image solar phenomena to heights approaching 2 solar radii. these observations include the detection of an apparent current sheet associated with magnetic reconnection in the wake of the eruption and evidence of an extreme-ultraviolet wave at some of the largest heights ever reported. we discuss the acceleration of the nascent coronal mass ejection to approximately 2000 kms at about 1.5 solar radii. we compare these observations with models of eruptions and eruption-related phenomena. we also describe the suvi data and discuss how the scientific community can access suvi observations of the event. 
  we present the assessment of a diffusion-dominated mean field axisymmetric dynamo model in reproducing historical solar activity and forecast for solar cycle 25. previous studies point to the sun's polar magnetic field as an important proxy for solar activity prediction. extended research using this proxy has been impeded by reduced observational data record only available from 1976. however, there is a recognised need for a solar dynamo model with ample verification over various activity scenarios to improve theoretical standards. the present study aims to explore the use of helioseismology data and reconstructed solar polar magnetic field, to foster the development of robust solar activity forecasts. the research is based on observationally inferred differential rotation morphology, as well as observed and reconstructed polar field using artificial neural network methods via the hemispheric sunspot areas record. results show consistent reproduction of historical solar activity trends with enhanced results by introducing a precursor rise time coefficient. a weak solar cycle 25, with slow rise time and maximum activity -14.4 \% (\pm 19.5\%) with respect to the current cycle 24 is predicted. 
  dust storms are common in arid zones on the earth and others planets such as mars. the impact of dust storms on solar radiation has significant implications for solar power plants and autonomous vehicles powered by solar panels. this paper deals with the analysis of solar radiation and power output of a rooftop photovoltaic plant during a dust storm and proposes a forecasting methodology using deep learning network. the increased aerosol content due to dust storms increases the diffuse component of the solar radiation. this effect persists for a long duration and can impact the quality of forecasting of solar radiation. deep learning networks that capture long range structure can improve the quality of solar radiation forecasting during dust storms. these results can help explain the sudden drop in power output of solar plants due to dust storms originating in another continent. they can shed light on mysterious cleaning events in autonomous vehicles powered by solar panels to be used in space missions.
